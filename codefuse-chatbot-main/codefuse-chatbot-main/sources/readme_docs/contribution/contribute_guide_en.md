There are many ways to participate in the Codefuse project and contribute to it: code implementation, test writing, process tool improvement, documentation enhancement, and more. We welcome any contributions and will add you to our list of contributors.

Furthermore, with enough contributions, you may have the opportunity to become a Committer for Codefuse.

For any questions, you can contact us for timely answers through various means including WeChat, Gitter (an instant messaging tool provided by GitHub), email, and more.

Through the above methods, you can stay up-to-date with the development dynamics of the Codefuse project and express your opinions on topics of interest.


## Contributation Ways
This contribution guide is not just about writing code. We value and appreciate help in all areas. Here are some ways you can contribute:
- Documentation
- Issues
- Pull Requests (PR)

### Improve Documentation
Documentation is the main way for you to understand Codefuse and is also where we need the most help!

By browsing the documentation, you can deepen your understanding of Codefuse and also help you grasp the features and technical details of Codefuse. If you find any issues with the documentation, please contact us in time;

If you are interested in improving the quality of the documentation, whether it is revising an address of a page, correcting a link, or writing a better introductory document, we are very welcoming!

Most of our documentation is written in markdown format. You can directly modify and submit documentation changes in the docs/ directory on GitHub. For submitting code changes, please refer to Pull Requests.

### If You Discover a Bug or Issue
If you discover a bug or issue, you can directly submit a new Issue through GitHub Issues, and someone will handle it regularly. For more details, see Issue Template.[Issue Template](#issue-template)

You can also choose to read and analyze the code to fix it yourself (it is best to communicate with us before doing so, as someone might already be working on the same issue), and then submit a Pull Request.

### Modify Code and Submit a PR (Pull Request)
You can download the code, compile, install, and deploy to try it out (you can refer to the compilation documentation to see if it works as you expected). If there are any issues, you can directly contact us, submit an Issue, or fix it yourself by reading and analyzing the source code. For more details, see[Contribution](#contribution)

Whether it's fixing a bug or adding a feature, we warmly welcome it. If you wish to submit code to Doris, you need to fork the code repository to your project space on GitHub, create a new branch for your submitted code, add the original project as an upstream, and submit a PR. The method for submitting a PR can be referenced in the Pull Request documentation.


## Issue Type
Issues can be categorized into three types:
- Bug: Issues where code or execution examples contain bugs or lack dependencies, resulting in incorrect execution.
