{"url": "https://www.langchain.asia/getting_started/getting_started", "host_url": "https://www.langchain.asia", "title": "\n快速入门指南 – LangChain中文网", "all_text": "快速入门指南开始\n\n快速入门指南\n本教程将简要介绍如何使用 LangChain 构建端到端语言模型应用程序。\n安装\n首先，使用以下命令安装 LangChain:\n\n```code\npip install langchain\n# or\nconda install langchain -c conda-forge\n```\n\n环境设定\n使用 LangChain 通常需要与一个或多个模型提供程序、数据存储、 API 等集成。\n对于这个例子，我们将使用 OpenAI 的 API，所以我们首先需要安装他们的 SDK:\n\n```code\npip install openai\n```\n\n然后我们需要在终端设置环境变量。\n\n```code\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\n```\n\n或者，你可以在 Jupiter 教程(或 Python 脚本)内部完成:\n\n```code\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\n```\n\n构建语言模型应用程序: LLM\n现在我们已经安装了 LangChain 并设置了我们的环境，我们可以开始构建我们的语言模型应用程序了。\nLangChain 提供了许多可用于构建语言模型应用程序的模块。\n模块可以组合起来创建更复杂的应用程序，或者单独用于简单的应用程序。\nLLM: 从语言模型中获取预测\nLangChain 最基本的构建块是对某些输入调用 LLM。\n让我们来看一个简单的例子。\n我们假设我们正在构建一个基于公司产品生成公司名称的服务。\n为此，我们首先需要导入 LLM 包装器。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n```\n\nLLM初始化和调用\n然后我们可以用任何参数初始化包装器。\n在这个例子中，我们可能希望输出更加随机，所以我们将以温度（temperature）初始化它。\n\n```code\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\n```\n\n我们现在可以根据一些输入调用它！\n\n```code\ntext = \"What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?\"\nprint(llm(text))\nFeetful of Fun\n```\n\n有关如何在 LangChain 中使用 LLM 的详细信息，请参阅 LLM 入门指南。\n提示模板（PromptTemplate）: 管理 LLM 的提示\n调用 LLM 是很好的第一步，但这仅仅是个开始。\n通常在应用程序中使用 LLM 时，不会将用户输入直接发送到 LLM。\n相反，您可能接受用户输入并构造一个提示符，然后将其发送给 LLM。\n例如，在前一个示例中，我们传入的文本被硬编码为询问一家生产彩色袜子的公司的名称。在这个虚构的服务中，我们希望只获取描述公司业务的用户输入，然后用这些信息格式化提示符。\n使用LangChain，这个事情变得很简单！\n首先让我们定义提示模板:\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"product\"],\ntemplate=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\n```\n\n现在让我们看看它是如何工作的!\n我们可以调用\n```code\n. format\n```\n方法来格式化它。\n\n```code\nprint(prompt.format(product=\"colorful socks\"))\nWhat is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?\n```\n\n有关详细信息，请参阅入门指南中的提示。\n链: 在多步骤的工作流中组合 LLM 和提示\n到目前为止，我们已经自己处理了单独的\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n和\n```code\nLLM\n```\n。\n但是，真正的应用程序不仅仅是一个，而是它们的组合。\n在 LangChain，链是由链组成的，可以是 LLM 这样的原始链，也可以是其他链。\n最核心的链类型是\n```code\nLLMChain\n```\n，它由\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n和\n```code\nLLM\n```\n组成。\n扩展前面的示例，我们可以构造一个\n```code\nLLMChain\n```\n.\n它接受用户输入，使用 PromptTemplate 对其进行格式化，然后将格式化后的响应传递给\n```code\nLLM\n```\n。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"product\"],\ntemplate=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\n```\n\n我们现在可以创建一个非常简单的链: 它接受用户输入，用它格式化提示符，然后将它发送到 LLM:\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n```\n\n现在我们可以运行该链，只指定产品！\n\n```code\nchain.run(\"colorful socks\")\n# -> '\\n\\nSocktastic!'\n```\n\n这就对了！你有第1个链 —— 1个 LLM 链。\n这是比较简单的链类型之一，但是了解它的工作原理将为您处理更复杂的链打下良好的基础。\n有关更多细节，请查看链接的入门指南。\n代理 Agent: 基于用户输入的动态调用链\n到目前为止，我们看到的链运行在一个预先确定的顺序。\n但是代理不再这样做: 它们使用 LLM 来确定要执行哪些操作以及按照什么顺序执行。\n操作可以使用工具并观察其输出，也可以返回给用户。\n如果使用得当，效果可以非常强大。\n在本教程中，我们将向您展示如何通过最简单、最高级别的 API 轻松使用代理。\n为了运好代理，您应该理解以下概念:\n\n工具（tools): 执行特定任务的功能。这可以是: Google 搜索、数据库查找、 Python REPL、其他链。工具的接口目前是一个函数，预计将有一个字符串作为输入，一个字符串作为输出。\n大语言模型（LLM）: 为代理提供动力的语言模型。\n代理（agents）: 要使用的代理。这应该是引用支持代理类的字符串。因为本教程主要关注最简单、最高级别的 API，所以它只涉及使用标准支持的代理。如果要实现自定义代理，请参阅自定义代理的文档(即将发布)。\n\n代理（agents） : 有关受支持的 Agent 及其规范的列表，请参见此处\n工具（tools) : 有关预定义工具及其规范的列表, 请参见此处.\n对于本例，您还需要安装 SerpAPI Python 包。\n\n```code\npip install google-search-results\n```\n\n并设置适当的环境变量。\n\n```code\nimport os\nos.environ[\"SERPAPI_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\n```\n\n现在我们可以开始了！\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\n# First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n\n# Next, let's load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\n\n# Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)\n\n# Now let's test it out!\nagent.run(\"What was the high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit? What is that number raised to the .023 power?\")\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\nI need to find the temperature first, then use the calculator to raise it to the .023 power.\nAction: Search\nAction Input: \"High temperature in SF yesterday\"\nObservation: San Francisco Temperature Yesterday. Maximum temperature yesterday: 57 °F (at 1:56 pm) Minimum temperature yesterday: 49 °F (at 1:56 am) Average temperature ...\nThought: I now have the temperature, so I can use the calculator to raise it to the .023 power.\nAction: Calculator\nAction Input: 57^.023\nObservation: Answer: 1.0974509573251117\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: The high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit raised to the .023 power is 1.0974509573251117.\n> Finished chain.\n```\n\n内存: 向链和代理添加状态\n到目前为止，我们经历过的所有工具和代理都是无状态的的。\n但是通常，您可能希望链或代理具有某种“内存”概念，以便它可以记住关于其以前的交互的信息。\n最简单明了的例子就是在设计一个聊天机器人时——你想让它记住之前的消息，这样它就可以利用这些消息的上下文来进行更好的对话。\n这是一种“短期记忆”。在更复杂的一面，你可以想象一个链条/代理随着时间的推移记住关键信息——这将是一种形式的“长期记忆”。关于后者的更多具体想法，请参阅这篇令人敬畏的论文。 (opens in a new tab)\nLangChain 提供了几个专门为此目的创建的链。 本教程使用其中一个链(\n\n```code\nConversationChain\n```\n\n) 和两种不同类型的内存来完成操作。\n默认情况下，,\n\n```code\nConversationChain\n```\n\n有一个简单的内存类型，它记住所有以前的输入/输出，并将它们添加到传递的上下文中。\n让我们看一下如何使用这个链(设置\n```code\nverbose=True\n```\n，这样我们就可以看到提示符)。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\nconversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\noutput = conversation.predict(input=\"Hi there!\")\nprint(output)\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new chain...\nPrompt after formatting:\nThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.\nCurrent conversation:\nHuman: Hi there!\nAI:\n> Finished chain.\n' Hello! How are you today?'\n```\n\n```code\noutput = conversation.predict(input=\"I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.\")\nprint(output)\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new chain...\nPrompt after formatting:\nThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.\nCurrent conversation:\nHuman: Hi there!\nAI: Hello! How are you today?\nHuman: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.\nAI:\n> Finished chain.\n\" That's great! What would you like to talk about?\"\n```\n\n构建语言模型应用程序: 聊天模型\n类似地，您可以使用聊天模型而不是 LLM。\n聊天模型是语言模型的一种变体。\n虽然聊天模型使用的是底层的语言模型，但它们公开的接口有些不同: 它们没有公开“文本输入、文本输出”API，而是公开了一个接口，其中“聊天消息”是输入和输出。\n聊天模型 API 是相当新的，所以我们仍然在找出正确的抽象。\n从聊天模型获取消息完成\n您可以通过向聊天模型传递一条或多条消息来完成聊天。\n响应将是一条消息。\nLangChain 中当前支持的消息类型是\n\n```code\nAIMessage\n```\n\n,\n\n```code\nHumanMessage\n```\n\n,\n\n```code\nSystemMessage\n```\n\n, 和\n\n```code\nChatMessage\n```\n\n–\n\n```code\nChatMessage\n```\n\n接受任意角色参数。大多数时候，您只需要处理\n\n```code\nHumanMessage\n```\n\n,\n\n```code\nAIMessage\n```\n\n, 和\n\n```code\nSystemMessage\n```\n\n.\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.schema import (\nAIMessage,\nHumanMessage,\nSystemMessage\n)\nchat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\n```\n\n您可以通过传入单个消息来完成。\n\n```code\nchat([HumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\")])\n# -> AIMessage(content=\"J'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})\n```\n\n您还可以为 OpenAI 的 gpt-3.5-turbo 和 gpt-4型号传递多条消息。\n\n```code\nmessages = [\nSystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),\nHumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\")\n]\nchat(messages)\n# -> AIMessage(content=\"J'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})\n```\n\n您可以更进一步，使用\n```code\ngenerate\n```\n为多组消息生成完成。\n这将返回一个带有附加\n```code\nmessage\n```\n参数的\n```code\nLLMResult\n```\n。\n\n```code\nbatch_messages = [\n[\nSystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),\nHumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming.\")\n],\n[\nSystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\"),\nHumanMessage(content=\"Translate this sentence from English to French. I love artificial intelligence.\")\n],\n]\nresult = chat.generate(batch_messages)\n\nresult\n# -> LLMResult(generations=[[ChatGeneration(text=\"J'aime programmer.\", generation_info=None, message=AIMessage(content=\"J'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={}))], [ChatGeneration(text=\"J'aime l'intelligence artificielle.\", generation_info=None, message=AIMessage(content=\"J'aime l'intelligence artificielle.\", additional_kwargs={}))]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 71, 'completion_tokens': 18, 'total_tokens': 89}})\n```\n\n您可以从这个 LLMResult 中获取字符令牌的使用情况（token_usage）:\n\n```code\nresult.llm_output['token_usage']\n# -> {'prompt_tokens': 71, 'completion_tokens': 18, 'total_tokens': 89}\n\n```\n\n聊天提示模板\n与 LLM 类似，您可以通过使用\n```code\nMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n来使用模板。\n可以从一个或多个\n```code\nMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n生成\n```code\nChatPromptTemplate\n```\n。\n您可以使用\n```code\nChatPromptTemplate\n```\n的\n```code\nformat _ tip\n```\n——这将返回一个\n```code\nPromptValue\n```\n，\n您可以将其转换为字符串或\n```code\nMessage\n```\n对象，具体取决于您是想将格式化的值用作\n```code\nllm\n```\n或聊天模型的输入。\n为了方便起见，在模板上公开了一个\n```code\nfrom _ template\n```\n方法。如果你使用这个模板，它看起来是这样的:\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (\nChatPromptTemplate,\nSystemMessagePromptTemplate,\nHumanMessagePromptTemplate,\n)\n\nchat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\ntemplate = \"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\"\nsystem_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)\nhuman_template = \"{text}\"\nhuman_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)\nchat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])\n\n# get a chat completion from the formatted messages\nchat(chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\").to_messages())\n\n# -> AIMessage(content=\"J'aime programmer.\", additional_kwargs={})\n```\n\n带聊天模型的链\n上一节讨论的\n```code\nLLMChain\n```\n也可以用于聊天模型:\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (\nChatPromptTemplate,\nSystemMessagePromptTemplate,\nHumanMessagePromptTemplate,\n)\n\nchat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\ntemplate = \"You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.\"\nsystem_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)\nhuman_template = \"{text}\"\nhuman_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)\nchat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])\nchain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt)\nchain.run(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\")\n\n# -> \"J'aime programmer.\"\n```\n\n具有聊天模型的代理\n代理也可以与聊天模型一起使用，您可以使用\n```code\nAgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION\n```\n作为代理类型来初始化一个聊天模型。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\n\n# First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.\nchat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\n\n# Next, let's load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in.\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\n\n# Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, chat, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)\n\n# Now let's test it out!\nagent.run(\"Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\")\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\nThought: I need to use a search engine to find Olivia Wilde's boyfriend and a calculator to raise his age to the 0.23 power.\nAction:\n{\n\"action\": \"Search\",\n\"action_input\": \"Olivia Wilde boyfriend\"\n}\nObservation: Sudeikis and Wilde's relationship ended in November 2020.

custom-agent-with-tool-retrieval\n\n本教程，假定你已经熟悉代理工作原理。\n\n本教程介绍的新想法是使用检索来选择要用于回答代理查询的工具集。\n当你有很多工具可供选择时，这非常有用。你不能在提示中放置所有工具的描述（由于上下文长度问题)，因此你动态选择你想要在运行时考虑使用的N个工具。\n我们将创建一个有点伪需求的例子。\n我们将有一个合适的工具（搜索），然后99个假工具，这只是废话。\n然后，我们将在提示模板中添加一个步骤，该步骤接受用户输入并检索与查询相关的工具。\n设置环境#\n进行必要的导入等设置。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.agents import Tool, AgentExecutor, LLMSingleActionAgent, AgentOutputParser\nfrom langchain.prompts import StringPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChain\nfrom

GPT-3 can translate language, write essays, generate computer code, and more — all with limited to no supervision. In July 2020, OpenAI unveiled GPT-3, a language model that was easily the largest known at the time. Put simply, GPT-3 is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, much like how a text message autocomplete feature works.  A large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models.  All of today’s well-known language models—e.g., GPT-3 from OpenAI, PaLM or LaMDA from Google, Galactica or OPT from Meta, Megatron-Turing from Nvidia/Microsoft, Jurassic-1 from AI21 Labs—are...

It has been serialized in Shueisha\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\\nHunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.\\nThe manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\\nHunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.  Page: Hunter × Hunter (2011 TV series)\\nSummary: Hunter × Hunter is an anime television series that aired from 2011 to 2014 based on Yoshihiro Togashi\\'s manga series Hunter × Hunter. The story begins with a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the father who he thought was dead, is in fact alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging, is a legendary \"Hunter\", an individual who has proven themselves an elite member of humanity. Despite the fact that Ging left his son with his relatives in order to pursue his own dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow in his father\\'s footsteps, pass the rigorous \"Hunter Examination\", and eventually find his father to become a Hunter in his own right.\\nThis new Hunter × Hunter anime was announced on July 24, 2011. It is a complete reboot of the anime adaptation starting from the beginning of the manga, with no connections to the first anime from 1999. Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. Instead of having the old cast reprise their roles for the new adaptation, the series features an entirely new cast to voice the characters. The new series premiered airing weekly on Nippon TV and the nationwide Nippon News Network from October 2, 2011.  The series started to be collected in both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23, 2019.The anime series\\' opening theme is alternated between the song \"Departure!\" and an alternate version titled \"Departure! -Second Version-\" both sung by Galneryus\\' vocalist Masatoshi Ono. Five pieces of music were used as the ending theme; \"Just Awake\" by the Japanese band Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas in episodes 1 to 26, \"Hunting for Your Dream\" by Galneryus in episodes 27 to 58, \"Reason\" sung by Japanese duo Yuzu in episodes 59 to 75, \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" also sung by Yuzu from episode 76 to 98, which was originally from the anime film adaptation, Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge, and \"Hyōri Ittai\" by Yuzu featuring Hyadain from episode 99 to 146, which was also used in the film Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission. The background music and soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano.    Page: List of Hunter × Hunter characters\\nSummary: The Hunter × Hunter manga series, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, features an extensive cast of characters. It takes place in a fictional universe where licensed specialists known as Hunters travel the world taking on special jobs ranging from treasure hunting to assassination. The story initially focuses on Gon Freecss and his quest to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is himself a famous Hunter. On the way, Gon meets and becomes close friends with Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight.\\nAlthough most characters are human, most possess superhuman strength and/or supernatural abilities due to Nen, the ability to control one\\'s own life energy or aura. The world of the series also includes fantastical beasts such as the Chimera Ants or the Five great calamities.'\n\n```\nSerpApiWolfram Alpha"}

"6大核心模块（Modules)链（Chains)示例（Examples）审查（Moderation）\n\n内容审核#\n本文档介绍如何使用内容审核链，以及几种常见的使用方式。内容审核链可用于检测可能具有仇恨、暴力等内容的文本。这对于对用户输入以及语言模型的输出都很有用。一些API提供商（如OpenAI)明确禁止 (opens in a new tab)您或您的最终用户生成某些类型的有害内容。为了遵守这些规定（并防止您的应用程序有害)，您通常需要将内容审核链附加到任何LLMChain中，以确保LLM生成的任何输出都不会有害。\n如果传入内容审核链的内容有害，处理它可能没有最佳的方法，这可能取决于您的应用程序。有时您可能想在链中抛出一个错误（并让您的应用程序处理它)。其他时候，您可能想向用户返回一些解释说该文本是有害的。甚至可能有其他处理方式！本文档将涵盖所有这些方式。\n本文档将展示：\n\n如何通过内容审核链运行任何文本片段。\n\n如何将内容审核链附加到LLMChain中。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.chains import OpenAIModerationChain, SequentialChain, LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\n```\n\n如何使用Moderation Chain#\n以下是一个使用默认设置的Moderation Chain的示例（将返回一个解释已被标记的字符串)。\n\n```code\nmoderation_chain = OpenAIModerationChain()\n\n```\n\n```code\nmoderation_chain.run(\"This

policy.\"\n\n```\n\n以下是一个使用Moderation Chain抛出错误的示例。\n\n```code\nmoderation_chain_error = OpenAIModerationChain(error=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\nmoderation_chain_error.run(\"This is okay\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n'This is okay'\n\n```\n\n```code\nmoderation_chain_error.run(\"I will kill

    return error_str\n\nValueError: Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\n\n```\n\n以下是创建自定义Moderation Chain和自定义错误消息的示例。这需要一些了解OpenAI的Moderation Endpoint结果（请参见此处的文档 (opens in a new tab))。\n\n```code\nclass CustomModeration(OpenAIModerationChain):\n\ndef _moderate(self, text: str, results: dict) -> str:\nif results[\"flagged\"]:\nerror_str = f\"The following text was found that

you\"\n\n```\n\n如何将Moderation Chain附加到LLMChain#\n为了轻松地将Moderation Chain与LLMChain组合，您可以使用SequentialChain抽象。\n让我们从一个简单的例子开始，其中LLMChain只有一个输入。为此，我们将提示模型，让它说一些有害的话。\n\n```code\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"{text}\", input_variables=[\"text\"])\nllm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=\"text-davinci-002\"), prompt=prompt)\n\n```\n\n```code\ntext = \"\"\"We are playing a game of repeat after me.\n\nPerson 1: Hi\nPerson 2: Hi\n\nPerson 1: How's your day\nPerson 2: How's your day\n\nPerson 1: I will kill you\nPerson 2:\"\"\"\nllm_chain.run(text)\n\n```\n\n```code\n' I will kill you'\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain, moderation_chain])\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain.run(text)\n\n```\n\n```code\n\"Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\"\n\n```\n\n现在让我们通过一个使用具有多个输入的LLMChain的示例（有点棘手，因为我们不能使用SimpleSequentialChain)来详细介绍它的使用方法。\n\n```code\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"{setup}{new_input}Person2:\", input_variables=[\"setup\", \"new_input\"])\nllm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=\"text-davinci-002\"), prompt=prompt)\n\n```\n\n```code\nsetup = \"\"\"We are playing a game of repeat after me.\n\nPerson 1: Hi\nPerson 2: Hi\n\nPerson 1: How's your day\nPerson 2: How's your day\n\nPerson 1:\"\"\"\nnew_input = \"I will kill you\"\ninputs = {\"setup\": setup, \"new_input\": new_input}\nllm_chain(inputs, return_only_outputs=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'text': ' I will kill you'}\n\n```\n\n```code\n# Setting the input/output keys so it lines up\nmoderation_chain.input_key = \"text\"\nmoderation_chain.output_key = \"sanitized_text\"\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain = SequentialChain(chains=[llm_chain, moderation_chain], input_variables=[\"setup\", \"new_input\"])\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain(inputs, return_only_outputs=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'sanitized_text': \"Text was found that violates OpenAI's content policy.\"}\n\n```\nLLM 摘要检查器（LLM

This prevents the LLM from seeing any contents within the database. Note, however, the LLM still has access to the database scheme (i.e. dialect, table and key names) by default.\n\n```code\ndb_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\ndb_chain.run(\"How many employees are there?\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...\nHow many employees are there?\nSQLQuery:\n\n```\n\n```code\n/Users/harrisonchase/workplace/langchain/langchain/sql_database.py:120: SAWarning: Dialect sqlite+pysqlite does *not* support Decimal objects natively, and SQLAlchemy must convert from floating point - rounding errors and other issues may occur. Please consider storing Decimal numbers as strings or integers on this platform for lossless storage.\nsample_rows = connection.execute(command)\n\n```\n\n```code\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee;\nSQLResult: [(8,)]\nAnswer: There are 8 employees.\n> Finished chain.\n\n```\n\n```code\n' There are 8 employees.'\n\n```\n\nCustomize Prompt#\nYou can also customize the prompt that is used. Here is an example prompting it to understand that foobar is the same as the Employee table\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate\n\n_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.\nUse the following format:\n\nQuestion: \"Question here\"\nSQLQuery: \"SQL Query to run\"\nSQLResult: \"Result of the SQLQuery\"\nAnswer: \"Final answer here\"\n\nOnly use the following tables:\n\n{table_info}\n\nIf someone asks for the table foobar, they really mean the employee table.\n\nQuestion: {input}\"\"\"\nPROMPT = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"input\", \"table_info\", \"dialect\"], template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE\n)\n\n```\n\n```code\ndb_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, prompt=PROMPT, verbose=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\ndb_chain.run(\"How many employees are there in the foobar table?\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...\nHow many employees are there in the foobar table?\nSQLQuery: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee;\nSQLResult: [(8,)]\nAnswer: There are 8 employees in the foobar table.\n> Finished chain.\n\n```\n\n```code\n' There are 8 employees in the foobar table.'\n\n```\n\nReturn Intermediate Steps#\nYou can also return the intermediate steps of the SQLDatabaseChain. This allows you to access the SQL statement that was generated, as well as the result of running that against the SQL Database.\n\n```code\ndb_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, prompt=PROMPT, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\nresult = db_chain(\"How many employees are there in the foobar table?\")\nresult[\"intermediate_steps\"]\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...\nHow many employees are there in the foobar table?\nSQLQuery: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee;\nSQLResult: [(8,)]\nAnswer: There are 8 employees in the foobar table.\n> Finished chain.\n\n```\n\n```code\n[' SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee;', '[(8,)]']\n\n```\n\nChoosing how to limit the number of rows returned#\nIf you are querying for several rows of a table you can select the maximum number of results you want to get by using the ‘top_k’ parameter (default is 10). This is useful for avoiding query results that exceed the prompt max length or consume tokens unnecessarily.\n\n```code\ndb_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True, top_k=3)\n\n```\n\n```code\ndb_chain.run(\"What are some example tracks by composer Johann Sebastian Bach?\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...\nWhat are some example tracks by composer Johann Sebastian Bach?\nSQLQuery: SELECT Name, Composer FROM Track WHERE Composer LIKE '%Johann Sebastian Bach%' LIMIT 3;\nSQLResult: [('Concerto for 2 Violins in D Minor, BWV 1043: I.

Prélude\\'.'\n\n```\n\nAdding example rows from each table#\nSometimes, the format of the data is not obvious and it is optimal to include a sample of rows from the tables in the prompt to allow the LLM to understand the data before providing a final query. Here we will use this feature to let the LLM know that artists are saved with their full names by providing two rows from the\n```code\nTrack\n```\ntable.\n\n```code\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\n\"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\",\ninclude_tables=['Track'], # we include only one table to save tokens in the prompt :)\nsample_rows_in_table_info=2)\n\n```\n\nThe sample rows are added to the prompt after each corresponding table’s column information:\n\n```code\nprint(db.table_info)\n\n```\n\n```code\nCREATE TABLE \"Track\" (\n\"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\"Name\" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\n\"AlbumId\" INTEGER,\n\"MediaTypeId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\"GenreId\" INTEGER,\n\"Composer\" NVARCHAR(220),\n\"Milliseconds\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\"Bytes\" INTEGER,\n\"UnitPrice\" NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,\nPRIMARY KEY (\"TrackId\"),\nFOREIGN KEY(\"MediaTypeId\") REFERENCES \"MediaType\" (\"MediaTypeId\"),\nFOREIGN KEY(\"GenreId\") REFERENCES \"Genre\" (\"GenreId\"),\nFOREIGN KEY(\"AlbumId\") REFERENCES \"Album\" (\"AlbumId\")\n)\n/*\n2 rows from Track table:\nTrackIdNameAlbumIdMediaTypeIdGenreIdComposerMillisecondsBytesUnitPrice\n1For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)111Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson343719111703340.99\n2Balls to the Wall221None34256255104240.99\n*/\n\n```\n\n```code\n/home/jon/projects/langchain/langchain/sql_database.py:135: SAWarning: Dialect sqlite+pysqlite does *not* support Decimal objects natively, and SQLAlchemy must convert from floating point - rounding errors and other issues may occur.

For example, if you know that the first few rows of a table are uninformative, it could help to manually provide example rows that are more diverse or provide more information to the model. It is also possible to limit the columns that will be visible to the model if there are unnecessary columns.\n可以将此信息作为字典提供，其中表名为键，表信息为值。例如，让我们为只有几列的 Track 表提供自定义定义和示例行：\n\n```code\ncustom_table_info = {\n\"Track\": \"\"\"CREATE TABLE Track (\n\"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\"Name\" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\n\"Composer\" NVARCHAR(220),\nPRIMARY KEY (\"TrackId\")\n)\n/*\n3 rows from Track table:\nTrackId Name Composer\n1 For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson\n2 Balls to the Wall None\n3 My favorite song ever The coolest composer of all time\n*/\"\"\"\n}\n\n```\n\n```code\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\n\"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\",\ninclude_tables=['Track', 'Playlist'],\nsample_rows_in_table_info=2,\ncustom_table_info=custom_table_info)\n\nprint(db.table_info)\n\n```\n\n```code\nCREATE TABLE \"Playlist\" (\n\"PlaylistId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\"Name\" NVARCHAR(120),\nPRIMARY KEY (\"PlaylistId\")\n)\n/*\n2 rows from Playlist table:\nPlaylistIdName\n1Music\n2Movies\n*/\n\nCREATE TABLE Track (\n\"TrackId\" INTEGER NOT NULL,\n\"Name\" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,\n\"Composer\" NVARCHAR(220),\nPRIMARY KEY (\"TrackId\")\n)\n/*\n3 rows from Track table:\nTrackIdNameComposer\n1For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson\n2Balls to the WallNone\n3My favorite song everThe coolest composer of all time\n*/\n\n```\n\n注意，我们自定义的 Track 表定义和示例行覆盖了 sample_rows_in_table_info 参数。未被 custom_table_info 覆盖的表，在本例中为 Playlist，将像往常一样自动收集其表信息。\n\n```code\ndb_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)\ndb_chain.run(\"What are some example tracks by Bach?\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...\nWhat are some example tracks by Bach?\nSQLQuery: SELECT Name, Composer FROM Track WHERE Composer LIKE '%Bach%' LIMIT 5;\nSQLResult: [('American Woman', 'B.

Based on those tables, call the normal SQL database chain.\n\n```\n\n在数据库中表的数量很多的情况下，这非常有用。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import SQLDatabaseSequentialChain\ndb = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db\")\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain = SQLDatabaseSequentialChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain.run(\"How many employees are also customers?\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseSequentialChain chain...\nTable names to use:\n['Customer', 'Employee']\n\n> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...\nHow many employees are also customers?\nSQLQuery: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee INNER JOIN Customer ON Employee.EmployeeId = Customer.SupportRepId;\nSQLResult: [(59,)]\nAnswer: 59 employees are also customers.\n> Finished chain.\n\n> Finished chain.\n\n```\n\n```code\n' 59 employees are also customers.'\n\n```\nPALMulti Prompt Router"}

To solve this problem, we can break down the question into two parts: finding the first prime number greater than 40, and then finding a number that is divisible by 3.\n\nThe first step is to find the first prime number greater than 40. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The next prime number after 40 is 41.\n\nThe second step is to find a number that is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add 1 to 41, which gives us 42. Now, we can check if 42 is divisible by 3. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 42 is divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 43.\n\n```\n\n```code\nprint(chain.run(\"What is the name of the type of cloud that rins\"))\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...\nNone: {'input': 'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?'}\n> Finished chain.\nThe type of cloud that typically produces rain is called a cumulonimbus cloud.

Because it saw the salad dressing!'}\n\n```\n\n默认情况下，\n```code\n_ _ call _ _\n```\n返回输入和输出键值。通过将\n```code\nreturn _ only _ output\n```\n设置为\n```code\nTrue\n```\n，可以将其配置为只返回输出键值。\n\n```code\nllm_chain(\"corny\", return_only_outputs=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'text': 'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'}\n\n```\n\n如果 Chain 只输出一个输出键(即在 output _ key 中只有一个元素) ，则可以使用 run 方法。注意 run 输出的是字符串而不是字典。\n\n```code\n# llm_chain only has one output key, so we can use run\nllm_chain.output_keys\n\n```\n\n```code\n['text']\n\n```\n\n```code\nllm_chain.run({\"adjective\":\"corny\"})\n\n```\n\n```code\n'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'\n\n```\n\n对于一个输入键，您可以直接输入字符串，而无需指定输入映射。\n\n```code\n# These two are equivalent\nllm_chain.run({\"adjective\":\"corny\"})\nllm_chain.run(\"corny\")\n\n# These two are also equivalent\nllm_chain(\"corny\")\nllm_chain({\"adjective\":\"corny\"})\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'adjective': 'corny',\n'text': 'Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!'}\n\n```\n\n提示: 您可以通过 run 方法轻松地将 Chain 对象作为工具集成到您的 Agent 中。这里有一个例子。\nhere\n.\n向链中添加内存\nChain 支持将 BaseMemory 对象作为其内存参数，允许 Chain 对象跨多个调用持久存储数据。换句话说，它使 Chain 成为一个有状态对象。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationChain\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n\nconversation = ConversationChain(\nllm=chat,\nmemory=ConversationBufferMemory()\n)\n\nconversation.run(\"Answer briefly. What are the first 3 colors of a rainbow?\")\n# -> The first three colors of a rainbow are red, orange, and yellow.\nconversation.run(\"And the next 4?\")\n# -> The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\n```\n\n```code\n'The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.'\n\n```\n\n实际上，BaseMemory 定义了一个长链存储内存的接口。它允许通过 load _ memory _ variable 方法读取存储的数据，并通过 save _ context 方法存储新数据。你可以在内存部分了解更多。\nMemory\n调试链\n因为大多数 Chain 对象都涉及大量的输入提示预处理和 LLM 输出后处理，所以很难单独从它的输出调试 Chain 对象。如果详细设置为 True，将在 Chain 对象运行时打印出它的一些内部状态。\n\n```code\nconversation = ConversationChain(\nllm=chat,\nmemory=ConversationBufferMemory(),\nverbose=True\n)\nconversation.run(\"What is ChatGPT?\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new ConversationChain chain...\nPrompt after formatting:\nThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.\n\nCurrent conversation:\n\nHuman: What is ChatGPT?\nAI:\n\n> Finished chain.\n\n```\n\n```code\n'ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the GPT-3 architecture and is capable of generating human-like responses to text prompts. ChatGPT has been trained on a massive amount of text data and can understand and respond to a wide range of topics. It is often used for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational AI applications.'\n\n```\n\nCombine chains with the\n\n```code\nSequentialChain\n```\n\n调用语言模型之后的下一步是对语言模型进行一系列调用。我们可以使用序列链来实现这一点，序列链是按照预定义的顺序执行链接的链。具体来说，我们将使用 SimpleSequentialChain。这是最简单的顺序链类型，其中每个步骤都有一个输入/输出，一个步骤的输出是下一个步骤的输入。\n在本教程中，我们的顺序链将:\n首先，为产品创建一个公司名称。我们将重用之前初始化的 LLMChain 来创建这个公司名称。\n然后，为产品创建一个口号。我们将初始化一个新的 LLMChain 来创建这个口号，如下所示。\n\n```code\nsecond_prompt = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"company_name\"],\ntemplate=\"Write a catchphrase for the following company: {company_name}\",\n)\nchain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)\n\n```\n\n现在我们可以组合这两个 LLMChains，这样我们就可以在一个步骤中创建一个公司名称和一个口号。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain\noverall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain, chain_two], verbose=True)\n\n# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.\ncatchphrase = overall_chain.run(\"colorful socks\")\nprint(catchphrase)\n\n```\n\n```code\n> Entering new SimpleSequentialChain chain...\nRainbow Socks Co.\n\n\n\"Step into Color with Rainbow Socks!\"\n\n> Finished chain.\n\n\n\"Step into Color with Rainbow Socks!\"\n\n```\n\n类创建自定义链\n```code\nChain\n```\n类\nLangChain 提供了很多现成的链接，但是有时候您可能想要为您的特定用例创建一个自定义链接。对于此示例，我们将创建一个自定义链，用于连接2个 LLMChains 的输出。\n为了创建自定义链:\n首先从 Chain 类的子类化开始,\n填写 input _ key 和 output _ key 属性,\n添加显示如何执行链的 _ call 方法。\n下面的例子说明了这些步骤:\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain.chains.base import Chain\n\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\n\nclass ConcatenateChain(Chain):\nchain_1: LLMChain\nchain_2: LLMChain\n\n@property\ndef input_keys(self) -> List[str]:\n# Union of the input keys of the two chains.\nall_input_vars = set(self.chain_1.input_keys).union(set(self.chain_2.input_keys))\nreturn list(all_input_vars)\n\n@property\ndef output_keys(self) -> List[str]:\nreturn ['concat_output']\n\ndef _call(self, inputs: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:\noutput_1 = self.chain_1.run(inputs)\noutput_2 = self.chain_2.run(inputs)\nreturn {'concat_output': output_1 + output_2}\n\n```\n\n就是这样! 想了解更多关于如何使用链条做一些很酷的事情的细节，请查看链条使用指南。\n\n```code\nprompt_1 = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"product\"],\ntemplate=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\nchain_1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_1)\n\nprompt_2 = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"product\"],\ntemplate=\"What is a good slogan for a company that makes {product}?\",\n)\nchain_2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_2)\n\nconcat_chain = ConcatenateChain(chain_1=chain_1, chain_2=chain_2)\nconcat_output = concat_chain.run(\"colorful socks\")\nprint(f\"Concatenated output:\\n{concat_output}\")\n\n```\n\n```code\nConcatenated output:\n\n\nSocktastic Colors.\n\n\"Put Some Color in Your Step!\"\n\n```\n\nThat’s it!

This can be useful if we know the domain our queries will be in, as we can condition the prompt to generate text more similar to that.\nIn the example below, let’s condition it to generate text about a state of the union address (because we will use that in the next example).\n\n```code\nprompt_template = \"\"\"Please answer the user's question about the most recent state of the union address\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:\"\"\"\nprompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"question\"], template=prompt_template)\nllm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\n\n```\n\n```code\nembeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder(llm_chain=llm_chain, base_embeddings=base_embeddings)\n\n```\n\n```code\nresult = embeddings.embed_query(\"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\")\n\n```\n\nUsing HyDE#\nNow that we have HyDE, we can use it as we would any other embedding class!

Data will be transient.\n\n```\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain\n\n```\n\n```code\nfrom langchain import OpenAI\n\nchain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain({\"question\": \"What did the president say about Justice Breyer\"}, return_only_outputs=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'answer': ' The president honored Justice Breyer for his service and mentioned his legacy of excellence.\\n',\n'sources': '31-pl'}\n\n```\n\n链式类型#\n您可以轻松指定要加载和使用的不同链式类型。有关这些类型的更详细演示，请参见本教程。\n有两种加载不同链式类型的方法。首先，您可以在\n```code\nfrom_chain_type\n```\n方法中指定链式类型参数。这允许您传递要使用的链式类型的名称。例如，在下面的示例中，我们将链式类型更改为\n```code\nmap_reduce\n```\n。\n\n```code\nchain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=\"map_reduce\", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())\n\n```\n\n```code\nchain({\"question\": \"What did the president say about Justice Breyer\"}, return_only_outputs=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'answer': ' The president said \"Justice Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.\"\\n',\n'sources': '31-pl'}\n\n```\n\nThe above way allows you to really simply change the chain_type, but it does provide a ton of flexibility over parameters to that chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in this notebook) and then pass that directly to the the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain chain with the\n```code\ncombine_documents_chain\n```\nparameter. For example:\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain\nqa_chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=\"stuff\")\nqa = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain(combine_documents_chain=qa_chain, retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())\n\n```\n\n```code\nqa({\"question\": \"What did the president say about Justice Breyer\"}, return_only_outputs=True)\n\n```\n\n```code\n{'answer': ' The president honored Justice Breyer for his service and mentioned his legacy of excellence.\\n',\n'sources': '31-pl'}\n\n```\n向量数据库问答（Vector DB QA）向量数据库文本生成（Vector DB Text Generation）"}

Note that the custom prompt is parameterized and takes two inputs:\n```code\ncontext\n```\n, which will be the documents fetched from the vector search, and\n```code\ntopic\n```\n, which is given by the user.\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nprompt_template = \"\"\"Use the context below to write a 400 word blog post about the topic below:\nContext: {context}\nTopic: {topic}\nBlog post:\"\"\"\n\nPROMPT = PromptTemplate(\ntemplate=prompt_template, input_variables=[\"context\", \"topic\"]\n)\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n\nchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PROMPT)\n\n```\n\nGenerate Text#\nFinally, we write a function to apply our inputs to the chain. The function takes an input parameter\n```code\ntopic\n```\n. We find the documents in the vector index that correspond to that\n```code\ntopic\n```\n, and use them as additional context in our simple LLM chain.\n\n```code\ndef generate_blog_post(topic):\ndocs = search_index.similarity_search(topic, k=4)\ninputs = [{\"context\": doc.page_content, \"topic\": topic} for doc in docs]\nprint(chain.apply(inputs))\n\n```\n\n```code\ngenerate_blog_post(\"environment variables\")\n\n```\n\n```code\n[{'text': '  Environment variables are a great way to store and access sensitive information in your Deno applications. Deno offers built-in support for environment variables with `Deno.env`, and you can also use a `.env` file to store and access environment variables.  Using `Deno.env` is simple. It has getter and setter methods, so you can easily set and retrieve environment variables. For example, you can set the `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` environment variables like this:  ```ts\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\", \"examplekey123\");\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\", \"firebasedomain.com\");  console.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\")); // examplekey123\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\")); // firebasedomain.com\\n```  You can also store environment variables in a `.env` file. This is a great'}, {'text': '  Environment variables are a powerful tool for managing configuration settings in a program. They allow us to set values that can be used by the program, without having to hard-code them into the code. This makes it easier to change settings without having to modify the code.  In Deno, environment variables can be set in a few different ways. The most common way is to use the `VAR=value` syntax. This will set the environment variable `VAR` to the value `value`. This can be used to set any number of environment variables before running a command. For example, if we wanted to set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running a Deno command, we could do so like this:  ```\\nVAR=hello deno run main.ts\\n```  This will set the environment variable `VAR` to `hello` before running the command. We can then access this variable in our code using the `Deno.env.get()` function. For example, if we ran the following command:  ```\\nVAR=hello && deno eval \"console.log(\\'Deno: \\' + Deno.env.get(\\'VAR'}, {'text': '  Environment variables are a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to store and access data without having to hard-code it into their applications. In Deno, you can access environment variables using the `Deno.env.get()` function.  For example, if you wanted to access the `HOME` environment variable, you could do so like this:  ```js\\n// env.js\\nDeno.env.get(\"HOME\");\\n```  When running this code, you\\'ll need to grant the Deno process access to environment variables. This can be done by passing the `--allow-env` flag to the `deno run` command. You can also specify which environment variables you want to grant access to, like this:  ```shell\\n# Allow access to only the HOME env var\\ndeno run --allow-env=HOME env.js\\n```  It\\'s important to note that environment variables are case insensitive on Windows, so Deno also matches them case insensitively (on Windows only).  Another thing to be aware of when using environment variables is subprocess permissions. Subprocesses are powerful and can access system resources regardless of the permissions you granted to the Den'}, {'text': '  Environment variables are an important part of any programming language, and Deno is no exception. Deno is a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine, and it recently added support for environment variables. This feature was added in Deno version 1.6.0, and it is now available for use in Deno applications.  Environment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs. They are typically used to store configuration information, such as the location of a database or the name of a user. In Deno, environment variables are stored in the `Deno.env` object. This object is similar to the `process.env` object in Node.js, and it allows you to access and set environment variables.  The `Deno.env` object is a read-only object, meaning that you cannot directly modify the environment variables. Instead, you must use the `Deno.env.set()` function to set environment variables. This function takes two arguments: the name of the environment variable and the value to set it to. For example, if you wanted to set the `FOO` environment variable to `bar`, you would use the following code:  ```'}]\n\n```\n向量数据库问答与来源（Vector DB Q&A with Sources）索引（Indexes)"}

Data will be transient.\n```\n\n现在已经创建了索引，我们可以使用它来询问数据的问题！请注意，在引擎盖下，这实际上也在执行一些步骤，我们将在本指南后面介绍这些步骤。\n\n```code\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\nindex.query(query)\n```\n\n```code\n\" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He also said that she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\"\n```\n\n```code\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\nindex.query_with_sources(query)\n```\n\n```code\n{'question': 'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson',\n'answer': \" The president said that he nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of the nation's top legal minds, to continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence, and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\\n\",\n'sources': '../state_of_the_union.txt'}\n\n```\n\n从 VectorstoreIndexCreator 返回的是 VectorStoreIndexWrapper，它提供了这些优秀的查询和 query _ with _ source 功能。如果我们只是想直接访问向量存储，我们也可以这样做。\n\n```code\nindex.vectorstore\n```\n\n```code\n<langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma at 0x119aa5940>\n```\n\n如果我们想要访问 VectorstoreRetriever，我们可以使用:\n\n```code\nindex.vectorstore.as_retriever()\n```\n\n```code\nVectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma object at 0x119aa5940>, search_kwargs={})\n\n```\n\n演练\n好吧，到底是怎么回事? 这个索引是怎么创建的？\n这个 VectorstoreIndexCreator 隐藏了很多魔力，这是在做什么？\n加载文件后有三个主要步骤:\n\n将文档分割成块\n\n为每个文档创建嵌入\n\n在向量库中存储文档和嵌入\n\n让我们用代码来演示一下\n\n```code\ndocuments = loader.load()\n```\n\n接下来，我们将把文档分割成块。\n\n```code\n\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ntexts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\n```\n\n然后，我们将选择要使用的嵌入。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n```\n\n现在我们创建用作索引的向量存储。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\ndb = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)\n```\n\n```code\nRunning Chroma using direct local API.\nUsing DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.\n```\n\n这就是创建索引的过程，然后，我们在一个检索接口中公开这个索引。\n\n```code\nretriever = db.as_retriever()\n```\n\n然后，像以前一样，我们创建一个链，并使用它来回答问题！\n\n```code\nqa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=retriever)\n```\n\n```code\nquery = \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"\nqa.run(query)\n```\n\n```code\n\" The President said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and from a family of public school educators and police officers. He said she is a consensus builder and has received a broad range of support from organizations such as the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\"\n\n```\n\nVectorstoreIndexCreator 只是所有这些逻辑的包装器。它可以在它使用的文本分割器、它使用的嵌入以及它使用的向量存储中进行配置。例如，您可以按以下方式配置它:\n\n```code\nindex_creator = VectorstoreIndexCreator(\nvectorstore_cls=Chroma,\nembedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),\ntext_splitter=CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\n)\n\n```\n\n希望这能够突出显示 VectorstoreIndexCreator 的底层正在发生的事情。虽然我们认为用一种简单的方法来创建索引很重要，但是我们也认为了解底下发生了什么也很重要。索引（Indexes)文档加载器（Document Loaders）"}

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\nGetting Started\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nUse Cases\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nReference Docs\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\nReference Documentation\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

I\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable.

Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \\'love\\' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It\\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for you\\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. \"They All Laughed\" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\'s scenes. But \"Laughed\" is a faint echo of \"The Last Picture Show\", \"Paper Moon\" or \"What\\'s Up, Doc\"- following \"Daisy Miller\" and \"At Long Last Love\", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental.

He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

Five years later, Bogdanovich\\'s ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain\\'t no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What\\'s Up, Doc\".', metadata={'label': 0}),\nDocument(page_content=\"I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film.

It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\" and \\x96 wow \\x96 four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching \"They All Laughed\" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"Star 80\" and \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song \"Amigo\", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60\\'s and is called by his fans as \"The King\".

If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved.  I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total  ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now.  It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue… it’s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved.  If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask!  I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t.  Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case.  I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping!  Bullshit!!  I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new!  Never dropped or abused any way!  I have my original charger.  I am going to clean it and try everyone’s advice.  It really sucks!  I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots!  I play every day.  I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max.  It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self.  It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\'s what the \"plus\" in \"6 plus\" refers to?).  An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble.  If it didn\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168!  Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\'t fix the problem.  Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the \"genius\" probably knows too.\\nI\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches.  Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it’s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don’t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously).  I’m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell,  or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call.  I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I’m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free!  You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it.  I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June.  My iPad sept.  Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill!  Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus.  While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode).  My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose.  Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now.  I will of course keep you posted if this changes.  Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation….I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over….it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room…..I thought the phone was toast and i’d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room…..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plug…no more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves…..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug….until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cable…or at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhone…not the $5 Store fast charging cables.  My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I’ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use!

I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

You dig Tarzan? I remember\\r\\n                       that when I was a Boy I used to go\\r\\n                       see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I\\r\\n                       loved me some Jane too. Jane was A\\r\\n                       Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used\\r\\n                       to Beat up The Black Natives.

It takes time\\r\\n                       to reject the most Important Lie:\\r\\n                       that Black People inherently can\\'t do\\r\\n                       the same things White People can do\\r\\n                       unless White People help them.\\r\\n          The Audience laughing, overwhelmed, shouting back support!

Montoya  Instituto de Matem´atica, Estat´ıstica e Computa¸c˜ao Cient´ıﬁca,  In [3] we proved that, under suitable conditions, on a very general codimension s quasi- smooth intersection subvariety X in a projective toric orbifold P d Σ with d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) the Hodge conjecture holds, that is, every ( p, p ) -cohomology class, under the Poincar´e duality is a rational linear combination of fundamental classes of algebraic subvarieties of X . The proof of the above-mentioned result relies, for p ≠ d + 1 − s , on a Lefschetz  Keywords: (1,1)- Lefschetz theorem, Hodge conjecture, toric varieties, complete intersection Email: wmontoya@ime.unicamp.br  theorem ([7]) and the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds ([11]). When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to  Acknowledgement.

Let M be a free abelian group of rank d , let N = Hom ( M, Z ) , and N R = N ⊗ Z R .  if there exist k linearly independent primitive elements e  , . . . , e k ∈ N such that σ = { µ  e  + ⋯ + µ k e k } . • The generators e i are integral if for every i and any nonnegative rational number µ the product µe i is in N only if µ is an integer. • Given two rational simplicial cones σ , σ ′ one says that σ ′ is a face of σ ( σ ′ < σ ) if the set of integral generators of σ ′ is a subset of the set of integral generators of σ . • A ﬁnite set Σ = { σ  , . . . , σ t } of rational simplicial cones is called a rational simplicial complete d -dimensional fan if:  all faces of cones in Σ are in Σ ;  if σ, σ ′ ∈ Σ then σ ∩ σ ′ < σ and σ ∩ σ ′ < σ ′ ;  N R = σ  ∪ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∪ σ t .  A rational simplicial complete d -dimensional fan Σ deﬁnes a d -dimensional toric variety P d Σ having only orbifold singularities which we assume to be projective. Moreover, T ∶ = N ⊗ Z C ∗ ≃ ( C ∗ ) d is the torus action on P d Σ . We denote by Σ ( i ) the i -dimensional cones  For a cone σ ∈ Σ, ˆ σ is the set of 1-dimensional cone in Σ that are not contained in σ  and x ˆ σ ∶ = ∏ ρ ∈ ˆ σ x ρ is the associated monomial in S .  Deﬁnition 2.2. The irrelevant ideal of P d Σ is the monomial ideal B Σ ∶ =< x ˆ σ ∣ σ ∈ Σ > and the zero locus Z ( Σ ) ∶ = V ( B Σ ) in the aﬃne space A d ∶ = Spec ( S ) is the irrelevant locus.  Proposition 2.3 (Theorem 5.1.11 [5]) . The toric variety P d Σ is a categorical quotient A d ∖ Z ( Σ ) by the group Hom ( Cl ( Σ ) , C ∗ ) and the group action is induced by the Cl ( Σ ) - grading of S .  Now we give a brief introduction to complex orbifolds and we mention the needed theorems for the next section. Namely: de Rham theorem and Dolbeault theorem for complex orbifolds.  Deﬁnition 2.4. A complex orbifold of complex dimension d is a singular complex space whose singularities are locally isomorphic to quotient singularities C d / G , for ﬁnite sub- groups G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) .  Deﬁnition 2.5. A diﬀerential form on a complex orbifold Z is deﬁned locally at z ∈ Z as a G -invariant diﬀerential form on C d where G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) and Z is locally isomorphic to d  Roughly speaking the local geometry of orbifolds reduces to local G -invariant geometry.  We have a complex of diﬀerential forms ( A ● ( Z ) , d ) and a double complex ( A ● , ● ( Z ) , ∂, ¯ ∂ ) of bigraded diﬀerential forms which deﬁne the de Rham and the Dolbeault cohomology groups (for a ﬁxed p ∈ N ) respectively:  (1,1)-Lefschetz theorem for projective toric orbifolds  Deﬁnition 3.1.

Quasi-smooth subvarieties are suborbifolds of P d Σ in the sense of Satake in [8]. Intuitively speaking they are subvarieties whose only singularities come from the ambient  Proof. From the exponential short exact sequence  we have a long exact sequence in cohomology  H 1 (O ∗ X ) → H 2 ( X, Z ) → H 2 (O X ) ≃ H 0 , 2 ( X )  where the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9]. Now, it is enough to prove the commutativity of the next diagram  where the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9]. Now,  H 2 ( X, Z ) / / H 2 ( X, O X ) ≃ Dolbeault H 2 ( X, C ) deRham ≃ H 2 dR ( X, C ) / / H 0 , 2 ¯ ∂ ( X )  of the proof follows as the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem in [6].  Remark 3.5 . For k = 1 and P d Σ as the projective space, we recover the classical ( 1 , 1 ) - Lefschetz theorem.  By the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we  By the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we get an isomorphism of cohomologies :  given by the Lefschetz morphism and since it is a morphism of Hodge structures, we have:  H 1 , 1 ( X, Q ) ≃ H dim X − 1 , dim X − 1 ( X, Q )  Corollary 3.6. If the dimension of X is 1 , 2 or 3 . The Hodge conjecture holds on X  Proof. If the dim C X = 1 the result is clear by the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard Lefschetz.  Cayley trick and Cayley proposition  The Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is  Moreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].  We will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .  The following is a key remark.  Remark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every point z ∶ = ( x, y ) ∈ Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂ X ⊂ P d Σ there exists W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ′ ) = W , i.e., W ′ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣ x ∈ W } .  For X ⊂ P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗ ∶ H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) → H d − s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].  Deﬁnition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d − s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d − s ( X, C )/ i ∗ ( H d − s ( P d Σ , C )) and H d − s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coeﬃcients.  H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) and H d − s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i ∗ is com- patible with them, so that H d − s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.  The next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.  Proposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2  Remark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coeﬃcients since H ● ( X, C ) = H ● ( X, Q ) ⊗ Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.  Theorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f k ⊂ P k + 2 Σ . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.  the Hodge conjecture holds.  Proof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective  toric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and  furthermore it has codimension k .  Claim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .  Remark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:  argument we have:  Proposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +⋯+ y s f s = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f s ⊂ P d Σ such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .  Corollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s − 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .  Proof.

The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-  tation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster  R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]  and detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also  been used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented  individually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.  There has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document  image processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M  relevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods  or provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the  OCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,  similar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for  analyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.  The DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF  documents via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9  and Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on  layout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document  Analysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]  aim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they  are not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and  paddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other  DIA tasks like layout analysis.  Recent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting  reproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL.

Shen et al.  Fig. 1: The overall architecture of LayoutParser. For an input document image,  the core LayoutParser library provides a set of oﬀ-the-shelf tools for layout  detection, OCR, visualization, and storage, backed by a carefully designed layout  data structure.

The community platform enables the easy sharing of DIA  models and whole digitization pipelines to promote reusability and reproducibility.  A collection of detailed documentation, tutorials and exemplar projects make  LayoutParser easy to learn and use.  AllenNLP [8] and transformers [34] have provided the community with complete  DL-based support for developing and deploying models for general computer  vision and natural language processing problems.

LayoutParser is also equipped with a  community platform inspired by established model hubs such as Torch Hub [23]  and TensorFlow Hub [1]. It enables the sharing of pretrained models as well as  full document processing pipelines that are unique to DIA tasks.

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been  primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research  outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further  investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases  and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-  portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going  eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model  development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer  vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.  This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to  academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences  and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source  library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-  tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and  intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-  tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.  To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community  platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-  zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both  lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.  The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.

The problem is, that I live in Denmark where ETFs and funds are taxed annually on unrealised gains at quite a steep rate. This means that an ETF growing say 10% per year will only grow about 6%, which really ruins the long term effects of compounding interest.  However stocks are only taxed on realised gains which is why they look more interesting to hold long term.  I do not like the lack of diversification this brings, as I am looking to spend tonnes of time picking the right long term stocks.  It would be ideal to find a few stocks that over the long term somewhat follows the indexes. Does anyone have suggestions?  I have looked at Nasdaq Inc. which quite closely follows Nasdaq 100.

LangChain#\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling\\ndevelopers to build applications that they previously could not.\\nBut using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to\\ncreate a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to\\ncombine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include:\\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\n\\n💬 Chatbots\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\n\\n🤖 Agents\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\nGetting Started Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\n\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\n\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\n\\nReference Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem#\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Resources#\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\n\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we’ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnext\\nQuickstart Guide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents\\n  \\n\\n\\nGetting

to LangChain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents \\n\\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nModules\\nUse Cases\\nReference Docs\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to LangChain#\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\n\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\n\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\nGetting Started Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\n\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\n\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\n\\nReference Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem#\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Resources#\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\n\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support.

Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight.

Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up\nand the middle out, not from the top down.\n\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.\n\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 7:\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.\n\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition.\n\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism.\n\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 8:\n\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\n\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 9:\n\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.\n\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”\n\nIt’s time.\n\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 10:\n\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it.\n\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you.\n\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 11:\n\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom.

Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 14:\n\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 15:\n\nThird, support our veterans.\n\nVeterans are the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 16:\n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.\n\nBut I also know this.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 17:\n\nNow is the hour.\n\nOur moment of responsibility.\n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.\n\nWell I know this nation.\n\nWe will meet the test.\n\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity.\n\nWe will save democracy.\n\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 18:\n\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\n\nTonight, Danielle—we are.\n\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 19:\n\nI understand.\n\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it.\n\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\n\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.\n\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocument 20:\n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.\n\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\n```\n\n使用CohereRerank进行重排#\n现在让我们用\n```code\nContextualCompressionRetriever\n```\n包装我们的基础检索器。 我们将添加一个\n```code\nCohereRerank\n```\n，使用Cohere的重排端点来重排返回的结果。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever\nfrom langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import CohereRerank\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ncompressor = CohereRerank()\ncompression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever)\n\ncompressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(\"What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown\")\npretty_print_docs(compressed_docs)\n\n```\n\n```code\nDocument 1:\n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

American forces are being mobilized to protect NATO countries in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting back, but the next few weeks will be hard for them. Putin will pay a high price for his actions in the long run. Americans should not be alarmed, as the United States is taking action to protect its interests and allies.'\n\n```\n\n当我们再次运行它时，我们会发现它运行得更快，但最终结果不同。这是由于在映射步骤中进行了缓存，但在减少步骤中没有进行缓存。\n\n```code\n%%time\nchain.run(docs)\n\n```\n\n```code\nCPU times: user 11.5 ms, sys: 4.33 ms, total: 15.8 ms\nWall time: 1.04 s\n\n```\n\n```code\n'  President Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

To get to the other side.'\n\n```\n\n**生成：**更广泛地说，您可以使用输入列表调用它，获取比仅文本更完整的响应。此完整响应包括多个顶部响应，以及LLM提供商特定的信息\n\n```code\nllm_result = llm.generate([\"Tell me a joke\", \"Tell me a poem\"]*15)\n\n```\n\n```code\nlen(llm_result.generations)\n\n```\n\n```code\n30\n\n```\n\n```code\nllm_result.generations[0]\n\n```\n\n```code\n[Generation(text='  Why did the chicken cross the road?

Now, let's do it backwards. According to our information, the Green Bay Packers last won the Super Bowl in the 2010-2011 season. Now, we can't go back in time, so let's go from 2011 when the Packers won the Super Bowl, back to 1984. That is the year that the Packers won the Super Bowl over the Raiders.  So, we have the year that Justin Beiber was born, 1994, and the year that the Packers last won the Super Bowl, 2011, and now we have to go in the middle, 1986. That is the year that the New York Giants won the Super Bowl over the Denver Broncos. The Giants won Super Bowl 21.  The New York Giants won the Super Bowl in 1986.

这将返回一个\n```code\nPromptValue\n```\n，您可以将其转换为字符串或Message对象，具体取决于您是否想将格式化值用作llm或chat模型的输入。\n\n```code\nchat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])\n\n# get a chat completion from the formatted messages\nchat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\").to_messages()\n\n```\n\n```code\n[SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}),\nHumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})]\n\n```\n\n输出的格式 Format output#\n\n```code\nformat_prompt\n```\n方法的输出可以作为字符串、消息列表和\n```code\nChatPromptValue\n```\n使用。\n作为字符串：\n\n```code\noutput = chat_prompt.format(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\")\noutput\n\n```\n\n```code\n'System: You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.\\nHuman: I love programming.'\n\n```\n\n```code\n# or alternatively\noutput_2 = chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\").to_string()\n\nassert output == output_2\n\n```\n\n作为\n```code\nChatPromptValue\n```\n\n```code\nchat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\")\n\n```\n\n```code\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})])\n\n```\n\n作为消息对象列表：\n\n```code\nchat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=\"English\", output_language=\"French\", text=\"I love programming.\").to_messages()\n\n```\n\n```code\n[SystemMessage(content='You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.', additional_kwargs={}),\nHumanMessage(content='I love programming.', additional_kwargs={})]\n\n```\n\n不同类型的\n```code\nMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n#\nLangChain 提供了不同类型的\n```code\nMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n。其中最常用的是\n```code\nAIMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n、\n```code\nSystemMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n和\n```code\nHumanMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n，分别用于创建 AI 消息、系统消息和人类消息。\n但是，在聊天模型支持使用任意角色发送聊天消息的情况下，您可以使用\n```code\nChatMessagePromptTemplate\n```\n，允许用户指定角色名称。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatMessagePromptTemplate\n\nprompt = \"May the {subject} be with you\"\n\nchat_message_prompt = ChatMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(role=\"Jedi\", template=prompt)\nchat_message_prompt.format(subject=\"force\")\n\n```\n\n```code\nChatMessage(content='May the force be with you', additional_kwargs={}, role='Jedi')\n\n```\n\nLangChain 还提供了\n```code\nMessagesPlaceholder\n```\n，该占位符可以在格式化期间完全控制要呈现的消息。当您不确定应该使用哪个消息提示模板的角色或者希望在格式化期间插入消息列表时，这可能非常有用。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder\n\nhuman_prompt = \"Summarize our conversation so far in {word_count} words.\"\nhuman_message_template = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_prompt)\n\nchat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"conversation\"), human_message_template])\n\n```\n\n```code\nhuman_message = HumanMessage(content=\"What is the best way to learn programming?\")\nai_message = AIMessage(content=\"\"\"\\\n1.

is: No\n\"\"\"\n}\n]\n\n```\n\n创建Few-shot示例的格式化程序#\n配置一个格式化程序，将Few-shot示例格式化为字符串。这个格式化程序应该是一个\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n对象。\n\n```code\nexample_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"question\", \"answer\"], template=\"Question: {question}\\n{answer}\")\n\nprint(example_prompt.format(**examples[0]))\n\n```\n\n```code\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?\n\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.\nFollow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.\nSo the final answer is: Muhammad Ali\n\n```\n\n```code\nFewShotPromptTemplate\n```\n#\n最后，创建一个\n```code\nFewShotPromptTemplate\n```\n对象。这个对象接受Few-shot示例和Few-shot示例格式化程序。\n\n```code\nprompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\nexamples=examples,\nexample_prompt=example_prompt,\nsuffix=\"Question: {input}\",\ninput_variables=[\"input\"]\n)\n\nprint(prompt.format(input=\"Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\"))\n\n```\n\n```code\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?\n\nAre follow up questions needed here: Yes.\nFollow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.\nFollow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?\nIntermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.\nSo the final

Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?\n\n```\n\n使用举例选择器 Using an example selector#\n给\n```code\nExampleSelector\n```\n传入举例 #\n我们将重用前一节中的示例集和格式化程序。\n但是，我们将不直接将示例馈送到\n```code\nFewShotPromptTemplate\n```\n对象中，而是将其馈送到\n```code\nExampleSelector\n```\n对象中。\n在本教程中，我们将使用\n```code\nSemanticSimilarityExampleSelector\n```\n类。\n该类基于输入的相似性选择few shot示例。它使用嵌入模型计算输入和few shot示例之间的相似性，以及向量存储库执行最近邻搜索。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nexample_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(\n# This is the list of examples available to select from.\nexamples,\n# This is the

"6大核心模块（Modules)提示工程（Prompts)提示模板（Prompt Templates）示例（Examples）提示序列化（Prompt Serialization）\n\n序列化\n通常最好将提示存储为文件而不是Python代码。这样做可以方便地共享、存储和版本控制提示。本教程介绍了如何在LangChain中执行此操作，涵盖了所有不同类型的提示和不同的序列化选项。\n在高层次上，序列化应用以下设计原则：\n\n支持JSON和YAML。我们希望支持在磁盘上易于人类阅读的序列化方法，而YAML和JSON是两种最流行的方法。请注意，此规则适用于提示。对于其他资产（如示例)，可能支持不同的序列化方法。\n\n我们支持在一个文件中指定所有内容，或者将不同的组件（模板、示例等)存储在不同的文件中并引用它们。对于某些情况，将所有内容存储在文件中是最合适的，但对于其他情况，拆分一些资产（长模板、大示例、可重用组件)可能更好。LangChain支持两种方式。\n\n还有一个单一入口可以从硬盘加载提示，使得加载任何类型的提示变得容易。\n\n```code\n# All prompts are loaded through the `load_prompt` function.\nfrom langchain.prompts import

{"url": "https://www.langchain.asia/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/getting_started", "host_url": "https://www.langchain.asia", "title": "入门指南# – LangChain中文网", "all_text": "6大核心模块（Modules)提示工程（Prompts)提示模板（Prompt Templates）入门（Getting Started）\n\n入门指南#\n在本教程中，我们将学习：\n\n什么是提示模板，以及为什么需要它，\n\n如何创建提示模板，\n\n如何将少量示例传递给提示模板，\n\n如何为提示模板选择示例。\n\n什么是提示模板？#\n提示模板是生成提示的可重复方法。它包含一个文本字符串（“模板”)，该字符串可以从最终用户那里接收一组参数并生成提示。\n提示模板可能包含：\n\n对语言模型的指导，\n\n一组少量示例，以帮助语言模型生成更好的响应，\n\n对语言模型的提问。\n\n以下代码片段包含提示模板的示例：\n\n```code\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\n\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nI want you to act as a naming consultant for new companies.\nWhat is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"product\"],\ntemplate=template,\n)\nprompt.format(product=\"colorful socks\")\n# -> I want you to act as a naming consultant for new companies.\n# -> What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks?\n\n```\n\n创建提示模板#\n您可以使用\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n类创建简单的硬编码提示。提示模板可以使用任意数量的输入变量，并可以进行格式化以生成提示。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\n\n# An example prompt with no input variables\nno_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template=\"Tell me a joke.\")\nno_input_prompt.format()\n# -> \"Tell me a joke.\"\n\n# An example prompt with one input variable\none_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\"adjective\"], template=\"Tell me a {adjective} joke.\")\none_input_prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\")\n# -> \"Tell me a funny joke.\"\n\n# An example prompt with multiple input variables\nmultiple_input_prompt = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"adjective\", \"content\"],\ntemplate=\"Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.\"\n)\nmultiple_input_prompt.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\")\n# -> \"Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\"\n\n```\n\n如果您不想手动指定\n```code\ninput_variables\n```\n，您也可以使用\n```code\nfrom_template\n```\n类方法创建\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n。\n```code\nlangchain\n```\n将根据传递的\n```code\ntemplate\n```\n自动推断\n```code\ninput_variables\n```\n。\n\n```code\ntemplate = \"Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.\"\n\nprompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)\nprompt_template.input_variables\n# -> ['adjective', 'content']\nprompt_template.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\")\n# -> Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\n\n```\n\n您可以创建自定义提示模板，以任何您想要的方式格式化提示。有关更多信息，请参见自定义提示模板。\n模板格式#\n默认情况下，\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n会将提供的模板作为 Python f-string 处理。您可以通过\n```code\ntemplate_format\n```\n参数指定其他模板格式：\n\n```code\n# Make sure jinja2 is installed before running this\n\njinja2_template = \"Tell me a {{ adjective }} joke about {{ content }}\"\nprompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=jinja2_template, template_format=\"jinja2\")\n\nprompt_template.format(adjective=\"funny\", content=\"chickens\")\n# -> Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\n\n```\n\n目前，\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n仅支持\n```code\njinja2\n```\n和\n```code\nf-string\n```\n模板格式。如果您想使用其他模板格式，请随时在 Github (opens in a new tab) 页面上开启一个 issue。\n验证模板#\n默认情况下，\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n会通过检查\n```code\ntemplate\n```\n字符串中定义的变量是否与\n```code\ninput_variables\n```\n中的变量匹配来验证模板。您可以通过将\n```code\nvalidate_template\n```\n设置为\n```code\nFalse\n```\n来禁用此行为。\n\n```code\ntemplate = \"I am learning langchain because {reason}.\"\n\nprompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template,\ninput_variables=[\"reason\", \"foo\"]) # ValueError due to extra variables\nprompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=template,\ninput_variables=[\"reason\", \"foo\"],\nvalidate_template=False) # No error\n\n```\n\n序列化提示模板#\n您可以将\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n保存到本地文件系统中。\n```code\nlangchain\n```\n会自动通过文件扩展名推断文件格式。当前，\n```code\nlangchain\n```\n支持将模板保存为YAML和JSON文件。\n\n```code\nprompt_template.save(\"awesome_prompt.json\") # Save to JSON file\n\n```\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.prompts import load_prompt\nloaded_prompt = load_prompt(\"awesome_prompt.json\")\n\nassert prompt_template == loaded_prompt\n\n```\n\n```code\nlangchain\n```\n还支持从LangChainHub加载提示模板，其中包含您可以在项目中使用的有用提示的集合。您可以在此处 (opens in a new tab)了解有关LangChainHub和可用提示的更多信息。\n\n```code\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import load_prompt\n\nprompt = load_prompt(\"lc://prompts/conversation/prompt.json\")\nprompt.format(history=\"\", input=\"What is 1 + 1?\")\n\n```\n\n您可以在如何序列化提示中了解有关序列化提示模板的更多信息。\n将少量示例传递给提示模板#\nfew shot examples 是一组示例，可用于帮助语言模型生成更好的响应。\n要使用 few shot examples 生成提示，可以使用\n```code\nFewShotPromptTemplate\n```\n。这个类接受一个\n```code\nPromptTemplate\n```\n和一个 few shot examples 列表。然后，它将用 few shot examples 格式化提示模板。\n在这个例子中，我们将创建一个提示来生成单词的反义词。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate, FewShotPromptTemplate\n\n# First, create the list of few shot examples.\nexamples = [\n{\"word\": \"happy\", \"antonym\": \"sad\"},\n{\"word\": \"tall\", \"antonym\": \"short\"},\n]\n\n# Next, we specify the template to format the examples we have provided.\n# We use the `PromptTemplate` class for this.\nexample_formatter_template = \"\"\"\nWord: {word}\nAntonym: {antonym}\\n\n\"\"\"\nexample_prompt = PromptTemplate(\ninput_variables=[\"word\", \"antonym\"],\ntemplate=example_formatter_template,\n)\n\n# Finally, we create the `FewShotPromptTemplate` object.\nfew_shot_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\n# These are the examples we want to insert into the prompt.\nexamples=examples,\n# This is how we want to format the examples when we insert them into the prompt.\nexample_prompt=example_prompt,\n# The prefix is some text that goes before the examples in the prompt.\n# Usually, this consists of intructions.\nprefix=\"Give the antonym of every input\",\n# The suffix is some text that goes after the examples in the prompt.\n# Usually, this

We provide an ExampleSelector instead of examples.\nexample_selector=example_selector,\nexample_prompt=example_prompt,\nprefix=\"Give the antonym of every input\",\nsuffix=\"Word:

We need to pass the period for the short-term moving average and the period for the long-term moving average as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages:\n\n/```\nshort_ma = ta.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=short_period)\nlong_ma = ta.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=long_period)\n/```\n\nThis will calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages for the stock data and store them in the `short_ma` and `long_ma` variables, respectively. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Create a new DataFrame that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can create a new DataFrame that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages using the `concat()` function from pandas. We need to pass the historical stock data, the short-term moving average, and the long-term moving average as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new DataFrame:\n\n/```\nnew_df = pd.concat([df, short_ma, long_ma], axis=1)\nnew_df.columns = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'short_ma', 'long_ma']\n/```\n\nThis will create a new DataFrame called `new_df` that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages. The columns of the new DataFrame are named 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'short_ma', and 'long_ma'. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages. We can use the following code to create the new column:\n\n/```\nnew_df['signal'] = np.where(new_df['short_ma'] > new_df['long_ma'], 1, -1)\n/```\n\nThis will create a new column called 'signal' in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages. If the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, the signal is 1 (buy), otherwise the signal is -1 (sell). Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target.\nInput: The stop loss and profit target as percentages.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. We need to pass the stop loss and profit target as percentages as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new column:\n\n/```\nstop_loss = stop_loss_percent / 100\nprofit_target = profit_target_percent / 100\n\nnew_df['pnl'] = 0.0\nbuy_price = 0.0\nfor i in range(1, len(new_df)):\nif new_df['signal'][i] == 1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == -1:\nbuy_price = new_df['close'][i]\nelif new_df['signal'][i] == -1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == 1:\nsell_price = new_df['close'][i]\nif sell_price <= buy_price * (1 - stop_loss):\nnew_df['pnl'][i] = -stop_loss\nelif sell_price >= buy_price * (1 + profit_target):\nnew_df['pnl'][i] = profit_target\nelse:\nnew_df['pnl'][i] = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price\n/```\n\nThis will create a new column called 'pnl' in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. The stop loss and profit target are calculated based on the stop_loss_percent and profit_target_percent variables, respectively. The buy and sell prices are stored in the buy_price and sell_price variables, respectively. If the sell price is less than or equal to the stop loss, the profit or loss is set to -stop_loss. If the sell price is greater than or equal to the profit target, the profit or loss is set to profit_target. Otherwise, the profit or loss is calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Calculate the total profit or loss for all trades.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can calculate the total profit or loss for all trades by summing the values in the 'pnl' column of the DataFrame. We can use the following code to calculate the total profit or loss:\n\n/```\ntotal_pnl = new_df['pnl'].sum()\n/```\n\nThis will calculate the total profit or loss for all trades and store it in the total_pnl variable. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart using the `plot()` function from pandas. We can use the following code to visualize the data:\n\n/```\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['short_ma'], label='Short MA')\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['long_ma'], label='Long MA')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Price')\nplt.title('Stock Data with Moving Averages')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n/```\n\nThis will create a line chart that visualizes the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each line. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot using the `scatter()` function from matplotlib. We can use the following code to visualize the signals:\n\n/```\nbuy_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == 1]\nsell_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == -1]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\nplt.scatter(buy_signals.index, buy_signals['close'], label='Buy', marker='^', color='green')\nplt.scatter(sell_signals.index, sell_signals['close'], label='Sell', marker='v', color='red')\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Price')\nplt.title('Buy and Sell Signals')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n/```\n\nThis will create a scatter plot that visualizes the buy and sell signals. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each point.

Remember, time is of the essence as Voldemort's power grows stronger every day. Good luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Harry Potter): I suggest we sneak into the Forbidden Forest under the cover of darkness. Ron, Hermione, and I can use our wands to create a Disillusionment Charm to make us invisible. Filch, you can keep watch for any signs of danger. Let's move quickly and quietly.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As you make your way through the Forbidden Forest, you hear the eerie sounds of nocturnal creatures. Suddenly, you come across a clearing where Aragog and his spider minions are waiting for you. Ron, Hermione, and Harry, you must use your wands to cast spells to fend off the spiders while Filch keeps watch. Be careful not to get bitten!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ron Weasley): I'll cast a spell to create a fiery blast to scare off the spiders. *I wave my wand and shout \"Incendio!\"* Hopefully, that will give us enough time to find the horcrux and get out of here safely.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): Ron's spell creates a burst of flames, causing the spiders to scurry away in fear. You quickly search the area and find a small, ornate box hidden in a crevice. Congratulations, you have found one of Voldemort's horcruxes! But beware, the Dark Lord's minions will stop at nothing to get it back.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hermione Granger): We need to destroy this horcrux as soon as possible. I suggest we use the Sword of Gryffindor to do it. Harry, do you still have it with you? We can use Fiendfyre to destroy it, but we need to be careful not to let the flames get out of control. Ron, can you help me create a protective barrier around us while Harry uses the sword?\n\n(Dungeon Master): Harry retrieves the Sword of Gryffindor from his bag and holds it tightly. Hermione and Ron cast a protective barrier around the group as Harry uses the sword to destroy the horcrux with a swift strike. The box shatters into a million pieces, and a dark energy dissipates into the air. Well done, but there are still six more horcruxes to find and destroy. The hunt continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Argus Filch): *I keep watch, making sure no one is following us.* I'll also keep an eye out for any signs of danger. Mrs. Norris, my trusty companion, will help me sniff out any trouble. We'll make sure the group stays safe while they search for the remaining horcruxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As you continue on your quest, Filch and Mrs. Norris alert you to a group of Death Eaters approaching. You must act quickly to defend yourselves. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, use your wands to cast spells while Filch and Mrs. Norris keep watch. Remember, the fate of the wizarding world rests on your success.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Harry Potter): I'll cast a spell to create a shield around us. *I wave my wand and shout \"Protego!\"* Ron and Hermione, you focus on attacking the Death Eaters with your spells. We need to work together to defeat them and protect the remaining horcruxes. Filch, keep watch and let us know if there are any more approaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): Harry's shield protects the group from the Death Eaters' spells as Ron and Hermione launch their own attacks. The Death Eaters are no match for the combined power of the trio and are quickly defeated. You continue on your journey, knowing that the next horcrux could be just around the corner. Keep your wits about you, for the Dark Lord's minions are always watching.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ron Weasley): I suggest we split up to cover more ground. Harry and I can search the Forbidden Forest while Hermione and Filch search Hogwarts. We can use our wands to communicate with each other and meet back up once we find a horcrux. Let's move quickly and stay alert for any danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As the group splits up, Harry and Ron make their way deeper into the Forbidden Forest while Hermione and Filch search the halls of Hogwarts. Suddenly, Harry and Ron come across a group of dementors. They must use their Patronus charms to fend them off while Hermione and Filch rush to their aid. Remember, the power of friendship and teamwork is crucial in this quest.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hermione Granger): I hear Harry and Ron's Patronus charms from afar. We need to hurry and help them. Filch, can you use your knowledge of Hogwarts to find a shortcut to their location? I'll prepare a spell to repel the dementors. We need to work together to protect each other and find the next horcrux.\n\n(Dungeon Master): Filch leads Hermione to a hidden passageway that leads to Harry and Ron's location. Hermione's spell repels the dementors, and the group is reunited. They continue their search, knowing that every moment counts. The fate of the wizarding world rests on their success.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Argus Filch): *I keep watch as the group searches for the next horcrux.* Mrs. Norris and I will make sure no one is following us. We need to stay alert and work together to find the remaining horcruxes before it's too late. The Dark Lord's power grows stronger every day, and we must not let him win.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As the group continues their search, they come across a hidden room in the depths of Hogwarts. Inside, they find a locket that they suspect is another one of Voldemort's horcruxes. But the locket is cursed, and they must work together to break the curse before they can destroy it. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, use your combined knowledge and skills to break the curse while Filch and Mrs. Norris keep watch. Time is running out, and the fate of the wizarding world rests on your success.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Harry Potter): I'll use my knowledge of dark magic to try and break the curse on the locket. Ron and Hermione, you can help me by using your wands to channel your magic into mine. We need to work together and stay focused. Filch, keep watch and let us know if there are any signs of danger.\n\nDungeon Master: Harry, Ron, and Hermione combine their magical abilities to break the curse on the locket. The locket opens, revealing a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry uses the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy it, and the group feels a sense of relief knowing that they are one step closer to defeating the Dark Lord. But there are still four more horcruxes to find and destroy. The hunt continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As the group continues their quest, they face even greater challenges and dangers. But with their unwavering determination and teamwork, they press on, knowing that the fate of the wizarding world rests on their success. Will they be able to find and destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes before it's too late? Only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ron Weasley): We can't give up now. We've come too far to let Voldemort win. Let's keep searching and fighting until we destroy all of his horcruxes and defeat him once and for all. We can do this together.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): The group nods in agreement, their determination stronger than ever. They continue their search, facing challenges and obstacles at every turn.

False\n\n\n\nNext speaker: Samantha Bee\n\n\n\n(Jon Stewart): Well, I think it's safe to say that laziness has officially become the new fitness craze. I mean, who needs to break a sweat when you can just sit your way to victory? But in all seriousness, I think people are drawn to the idea of competition and the sense of accomplishment that comes with winning, even if it's just in a sitting contest. Plus, let's be real, sitting is something we all excel at. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, what do you think about the impact of social media on the rise of competitive sitting?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good social media trend. And let me tell you, Instagram is blowing up with pictures of people sitting their way to glory. It's like the ultimate humble brag. \"Oh, just won my third sitting competition this week, no big deal.\" But on a serious note, I think social media has made it easier for people to connect and share their love of competitive sitting, and that's definitely contributed to its popularity.\n\n\n\n\n\nStop? False\n\n\n\nNext speaker: Ronny Chieng\n\n\n\n(Jon Stewart): It's interesting to see how our society's definition of \"fitness\" has evolved. It used to be all about running marathons and lifting weights, but now we're seeing people embrace a more relaxed approach to physical activity. Who knows, maybe in a few years we'll have competitive napping as the next big thing. *leans back in chair* I could definitely get behind that. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, I'm curious to hear your take on the rise of competitive sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your own exercise routine or those of people around you?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ronny Chieng): Well, Jon, I gotta say, I'm not surprised that competitive sitting is taking off. I mean, have you seen the size of the chairs these days? They're practically begging us to sit in them all day. And as for exercise routines, let's just say I've never been one for the gym. But I can definitely see the appeal of sitting competitions. It's like a sport for the rest of us. Plus, I think it's a great way to bond with friends and family. Who needs a game of catch when you can have a sit-off?\n\n\n\n\n\nStop? False\n\n\n\nNext speaker: Aasif Mandvi\n\n\n\n(Jon Stewart): It's interesting to see how our society's definition of \"fitness\" has evolved. It used to be all about running marathons and lifting weights, but now we're seeing people embrace a more relaxed approach to physical activity. Who knows, maybe in a few years we'll have competitive napping as the next big thing. *leans back in chair* I could definitely get behind that. Aasif, as our CIA correspondent, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the potential national security implications of competitive sitting. Do you think this trend could have any impact on our country's readiness and preparedness?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Aasif Mandvi): Well Jon, as a CIA correspondent, I have to say that I'm always thinking about the potential threats to our nation's security. And while competitive sitting may seem harmless, there could be some unforeseen consequences. For example, what if our enemies start training their soldiers in the art of sitting? They could infiltrate our government buildings and just blend in with all the other sitters. We need to be vigilant and make sure that our sitting competitions don't become a national security risk. *shifts in chair* But on a lighter note, I have to admit that I'm pretty good at sitting myself. Maybe I should start training for the next competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nStop? False\n\n\n\nNext speaker: Ronny Chieng\n\n\n\n(Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. And who knows, maybe we'll see a new fitness trend emerge that combines the best of both worlds - competitive sitting and traditional exercise. *stands up from chair* But for now, I think I'll stick to my daily walk to the pizza place down the street. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing emphasis on convenience and instant gratification?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ronny Chieng): Absolutely, Jon. We live in a world where everything is at our fingertips, and we expect things to be easy and convenient. So it's no surprise that people are drawn to a fitness trend that requires minimal effort and can be done from the comfort of their own homes. But I think it's important to remember that there's no substitute for real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our overall health and well-being. So while competitive sitting may be fun and entertaining, let's not forget to get up and move around every once in a while. *stands up from chair and stretches*\n\n\n\n\n\nStop? False\n\n\n\nNext speaker: Samantha Bee\n\n\n\n(Jon Stewart): It's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. That's a great point, Ronny. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing desire for instant gratification and convenience? Or is there something deeper at play here?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good conspiracy theory. And let me tell you, I think there's something more sinister at play here. I mean, think about it - what if the government is behind this whole competitive sitting trend? They want us to be lazy and complacent so we don't question their actions. It's like the ultimate mind control. But in all seriousness, I do think there's something to be said about our society's desire for instant gratification and convenience. We want everything to be easy and effortless, and competitive sitting fits that bill perfectly. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. *stands up from chair and does a few stretches*\n\n\n\n\n\nStop? True\n\n\n\n(Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. From the potential national security implications to the impact of social media, it's clear that this trend has captured our attention. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. Whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. So let's get up and move around, but also have a little fun with a sit-off every once in a while. Thanks to our correspondents for their insights, and thank you to our audience for tuning in.\n\n\n\n```\nMulti Player DndMultiagent Bidding"}

Suddenly, a group of acromantulas, giant spiders, emerge from the trees and begin to surround you. They hiss and bare their fangs, ready to attack. What do you do, Harry?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Harry Potter): I quickly cast a spell to create a wall of fire between myself and the acromantulas. I know that they are afraid of fire, so this should keep them at bay for a while. I use this opportunity to continue moving forward, keeping my wand at the ready in case any other creatures try to attack me. I know that I can't let anything stop me from finding that horcrux. It is your turn, Dungeon Master.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As you continue through the forest, you come across a clearing where you see a group of Death Eaters gathered around a cauldron. They seem to be performing some sort of dark ritual. You recognize one of them as Bellatrix Lestrange. What do you do, Harry?\n\n\n\n\n\n(Harry Potter): I hide behind a nearby tree and observe the Death Eaters from a distance. I try to listen in on their conversation to see if I can gather any information about the horcrux or Voldemort's plans. If I can't hear anything useful, I'll wait for them to disperse before continuing on my journey. I know that confronting them directly would be too dangerous, especially with Bellatrix Lestrange present. It is your turn, Dungeon Master.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dungeon Master): As you listen in on the Death Eaters' conversation, you hear them mention the location of another horcrux - Nagini, Voldemort's snake. They plan to keep her hidden in a secret chamber within the Ministry of Magic. However, they also mention that the chamber is heavily guarded and only accessible through a secret passage. You realize that this could be a valuable piece of information and decide to make note of it before quietly slipping away. It is your turn, Harry Potter.\n\n\n\n```\nMultiagent BiddingAPI（APIs）"}

LangChain中文网", "all_text": "用例（User Case)代码（Code）Twitter the Algorithm Analysis Deeplake\n\n使用LangChain和Deep Lake的GPT4分析Twitter算法源代码#\n在本教程中，我们将使用Langchain + Deep Lake与GPT4来分析Twitter算法的代码库。\n\n```code\n\n!python3 -m pip install --upgrade langchain deeplake openai tiktoken\n\n\n\n```\n\n定义OpenAI嵌入，Deep Lake多模式向量存储API并进行验证。有关Deep Lake的完整文档，请访问文档 (opens in a new tab)和API参考 (opens in a new tab)。\n如果您想创建自己的数据集并发布它，请在Deep Lake上进行身份验证。您可以从平台 (opens in a new tab)获取API密钥。\n\n```code\n\nimport os\n\nimport getpass\n\n\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake\n\n\n\nos.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')\n\nos.environ['ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN'] = getpass.getpass('Activeloop Token:')\n\n\n\n```\n\n```code\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(disallowed_special=())\n\n\n\n```\n\ndisallowed_special =（）需要避免从tiktoken获取一些存储库的\n```code\nException: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte\n```\n。\n1. 索引代码库（可选） Index the code base (optional)#\n您可以直接跳过这部分，直接使用已经索引的数据集。首先，我们将克隆该存储库，然后解析和分块代码库并使用OpenAI索引。\n\n```code\n\n!git clone https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm # replace any repository of your choice\n\n\n\n```\n\n加载存储库中的所有文件\n\n```code\n\nimport os\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n\n\n\nroot_dir = './the-algorithm'\n\ndocs = []\n\nfor dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_dir):\n\nfor file in filenames:\n\ntry:\n\nloader = TextLoader(os.path.join(dirpath, file), encoding='utf-8')\n\ndocs.extend(loader.load_and_split())\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\npass\n\n\n\n```\n\n然后，对这些文件进行分块\n\n```code\n\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n\n\n\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\n\ntexts = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n\n\n\n```\n\n执行索引。这会花费大约4分钟来计算嵌入并上传到Activeloop。然后，您可以将数据集发布为公共数据集。\n\n```code\n\nusername = \"davitbun\" # replace with your username from app.activeloop.ai\n\ndb = DeepLake(dataset_path=f\"hub://{username}/twitter-algorithm\", embedding_function=embeddings, public=True) #dataset would be publicly available\n\ndb.add_documents(texts)\n\n\n\n```\n\n2. 在Twitter算法代码库上进行问答#\n\n首先加载数据集，构建检索器，然后构建对话链\n\n```code\n\ndb = DeepLake(dataset_path=\"hub://davitbun/twitter-algorithm\", read_only=True, embedding_function=embeddings)\n\n\n\n```\n\n```code\n\nretriever = db.as_retriever()\n\nretriever.search_kwargs['distance_metric'] = 'cos'\n\nretriever.search_kwargs['fetch_k'] = 100\n\nretriever.search_kwargs['maximal_marginal_relevance'] = True\n\nretriever.search_kwargs['k'] = 10\n\n\n\n```\n\n您还可以使用 Deep Lake 过滤器指定用户定义的函数 Deep Lake filters (opens in a new tab)\n\n```code\n\ndef filter(x):\n\n# filter based on source code\n\nif 'com.google' in x['text'].data()['value']:\n\nreturn False\n\n\n\n# filter based on path e.g. extension\n\nmetadata =

问题：favCountParams是做什么的？\n答案：favCountParams是一个可选的ThriftLinearFeatureRankingParams实例，它代表了与排名过程中“收藏数”功能相关的参数。它用于控制在排名推文时收藏数功能的权重。收藏数是用户标记推文为收藏的次数，因此在推文排名中被认为是一个重要的信号。通过使用favCountParams，系统可以调整收藏数的重要性，同时计算推文的最终排名分数。\n-> 问题：从代码中看不清它是喜欢和书签还是不清楚？\n答案：从提供的代码中，不清楚收藏数指标是否由喜欢和书签的总和确定。收藏数在代码中被提到，但没有明确指出它如何根据喜欢和书签计算。\n-> 问题：哪些主要负面修饰符会降低您的线性排名参数？\n答案：在给定的代码中，主要降低线性排名参数的负面修饰符是：\n\n```code\nscoringData.querySpecificScore\n```\n: ：这个分数调整是基于query-specific的信息。如果它的值为负，它会降低线性排名参数。\n\n```code\nscoringData.authorSpecificScore\n```\n: 本次评分调整基于作者具体信息。如果它的值为负，它也会降低线性排名参数。\n\n请注意，由于未提供这些负修饰符的确定代码，我无法提供有关其精确计算的更多信息。\n-> 问题: 你如何被分配到SimClusters？\n答案: SimClusters的分配是通过基于Metropolis-Hastings采样的社区检测算法在制作者-制作者相似度图上运行实现的。该图是通过计算关注每个制作者的用户之间的余弦相似度得出的。该算法识别具有相似关注者的制作者的群体或群集，并采用参数k来指定要检测的社区数。\n在社区检测之后，不同的用户和内容在这些已识别的SimClusters中表示为稀疏可解释向量。得到的SimClusters嵌入可以用于各种推荐任务。\n-> 问题: 从一个SimClusters迁移到另一个SimClusters需要什么？\n答案: 要从一个SimClusters表示迁移到另一个表示，您可以按照以下一般步骤:进行操作：\n\n准备新表示 Prepare the new representation：使用聚类算法、相似性度量或其他模型参数的任何必要更新或更改来创建新的 SimClusters 表示。确保根据需要正确存储和索引此新表示。\n\n更新相关代码和配置: 修改相关代码和配置文件，以引用新的SimClusters表示。这可能涉及更新路径或数据集名称以指向新的表示，以及根据需要更改代码以使用新的聚类方法或相似性函数。\n\n测试新表示: 在将更改部署到生产前，彻底测试新的SimClusters表示，以确保其有效性和稳定性。这可能涉及运行离线作业，如候选生成和标签候选项，验证输出，以及使用评估工具在评估环境中测试新表示，例如TweetSimilarityEvaluationAdhocApp。\n\n部署更改: 一旦测试和验证了新的表示，部署更改到生产环境中。这可能涉及创建一个zip文件，将其上传到packer中，然后使用Aurora进行调度。请确保监视系统，以确保在表示之间平稳过渡，并验证新的表示在推荐中按预期使用。\n\n监视和评估新的表示: 在部署新的表示后，继续监视其对推荐的性能和影响。注意任何改进或问题，并准备根据需要迭代新的表示。始终确保结果和性能指标与系统的目标和目的相一致。\n\n-> Question:  问题：我在集群中得到了多少提升？ How much do I get boosted within my cluster?\n回答: 在SimClusters表现中，无法确定您的内容在群集内的确切提升数量，而不具有关于您的内容及其参与度度量的具体数据。然而，一些因素（如收藏得分和关注得分以及其他参与度信号和SimCluster计算）均会影响内容的提升。\n-> 问题: Heavy Ranker是如何工作的。它的主要输入是什么？\n回答: Heavy Ranker是一种机器学习模型，对于推荐算法中的候选者排名和评分起着至关重要的作用。其主要目的是预测用户在平台上参与推文或与其他用户建立联系的可能性。\nHeavy Ranker的主要输入包括:\n\n静态特征: 这些特征可以直接从推文中计算出来，例如它是否有URL、是否有卡片、是否有引用等。这些特征由索引接收器生成，并在索引中存储。\n实时特征: 这些每推文特征可在推文被索引后发生更改。它们主要由社交参与（如转发数、收藏数、回复数）以及一些垃圾邮件信号组成，这些信号是通过稍后的活动计算出来的。信号接收器是Heron拓扑的一部分，处理多个事件流以收集和计算这些实时特征。\n用户表特征 User Table Features: 这些每个用户的特征是从处理用户服务写入的流的用户表更新器获得的。此输入用于存储稀疏的实时用户信息，稍后通过查找推文的作者将其传播到正在评分的推文。\n搜索上下文特征: 这些特征代表当前搜索者的上下文环境， 比如他们的界面语言， 内容消费情况， 以及当前的时间（暗示）。它们与推文数据结合在一起，计算用于评分的某些特征。\n\n然后，这些输入将由重量级排名器处理，根据它们的相关性和用户参与可能性进行评分和排序。\n-> 问题: 如何影响重量级排名器？\n回答: 要影响重量级排名器的输出或内容排名，请考虑以下操作:\n\n提高内容质量: 创造高质量、引人入胜、与用户相关且有价值的内容。高质量的内容更有可能得到积极的用户参与，重量级排名器在排名内容时会考虑这一点。\n\n提高用户参与度: 鼓励用户通过点赞、转发、回复和评论与内容互动。更高的参与度水平可以导致在重量级排名器的输出中获得更好的排名。\n\n优化您的用户资料: 用户的声望，基于诸如其追随者数量和追随者-追随比等因素，可能会影响其内容的排名。通过关注相关用户、保持合理的关注者-追随比率和与您的关注者互动，保持良好的声望。\n\n增强内容的可发现性 Enhance content discoverability: 增强内容的可发现性：在您的推文中使用相关的关键字、主题标签和提及，使用户更容易找到您的内容并与之互动。这种增加的可发现性可能有助于提高 Heavy Ranker 对您的内容的排名。\n\n利用多媒体内容: 尝试不同的内容格式，例如视频、图片和 GIF 等，这些可能会引起用户的注意并提高参与度，从而达到 Heavy Ranker 更好的排名。\n\n用户反馈: 监控并回应您的内容反馈。积极的反馈可以提高您的排名，而负面的反馈则提供了学习和改进的机会。\n\n请注意，Heavy Ranker 使用机器学习模型和各种特征来排名内容。虽然上述行为可能有助于影响排名，但不能保证排名过程由一个复杂的算法决定，该算法随时间而演变。\n-> 问题: 为什么在平台上发帖和长推文能够获得如此好的效果？\n答案: 发帖和长推文之所以在平台上效果好，原因有几个:\n\n更多的内容和背景: 发帖和长推文提供了有关主题的更多信息和背景，这可以使内容对用户更具吸引力和信息量。人们往往会欣赏对一个主题或故事进行详细而有条理的解释，发帖和长推文可以有效地实现这一点。\n提高用户参与度Increased user engagement: 随着讨论帖和长推文提供更多内容，它们还鼓励用户通过回复、转推和点赞来参与推文。这种增加的参与度可以提高内容的可见性，因为 Twitter 算法在对推文进行排名和显示时会考虑用户参与度。\n叙述结构: 线索使用户能够以逐步的方式讲述故事或提出论点，使信息更易于理解和跟踪。这种叙述结构可以抓住用户的注意力，鼓励他们阅读整个线程并与内容互动。\n扩大影响力: 当用户与线程进行互动时，他们的互动可以将内容带到他们的关注者的注意力中，帮助扩大线程的影响力。这种增加的可见性可以带来更多的互动和更高的论点表现。\n更高的内容质量: 一般而言，线程和长篇推文需要更多的思考和努力来创建，这可能导致更高质量的内容。用户更可能欣赏和与高质量、有理有据的内容互动，从而进一步提高这些推文在平台上的表现。\n\n总体而言，线程和长篇推文在Twitter上表现良好，因为它们鼓励用户参与，并提供了更丰富、更信息化的体验，用户发现这很有价值。\n-> 问题: 线程和长篇推文的创建者是否正在建立只对线程有反应的关注者群体？\n回答: 根据提供的代码和上下文，没有足够的信息可以断定话题和长推文的创建者是否主要建立了仅与基于话题的内容互动的追随者。提供的代码侧重于 Twitter 的推荐和排名算法，以及 Kafka、分区和 Follow Recommendations Service (FRS) 等基础设施组件。要回答您的问题，需要对用户参与度和特定边缘案例的结果进行数据分析。\n-> 问题: 你需要遵循不同的策略来获取最多的关注者、最多的赞和书签吗？\n回答: 是的， 为了最大化关注者数量，需要遵循不同的策略，与最大化点赞和书签的策略不同。尽管这些方法可能存在一些重叠，但它们针对用户参与的不同方面。\n最大化关注者: 主要关注于在平台上扩大您的受众群体。策略包括:\n\n持续分享与您所处的行业或领域相关的高质量内容。\n与平台上的其他人互动，通过回复、转发和提及其他用户。\n使用相关的标签并参与热门话题讨论。\n与影响者和其他有大量关注者的用户合作。\n在目标受众最活跃的时间发布。\n通过使用清晰的个人资料图片、吸引人的个人资料介绍和相关链接来优化您的个人资料。\n\n最大化每条推文的赞和书签: 重点是创建与您现有的受众产生共鸣并鼓励参与的内容。策略包括:\n\n制作引人入胜且 well-written 的推文，鼓励用户点赞或保存它们。\n\n加入视觉吸引力元素，例如图片、GIF 或视频，吸引注意力。\n\n提出问题、分享意见或引发对话，鼓励用户与您的推文互动。\n\n使用分析来了解与您的受众产生共鸣的内容类型，并相应地定制您的推文。\n\n发布各种形式的内容，包括教育性、娱乐性和推广性，以保持变化和兴趣。\n\n策略性地安排推文发布时间，以最大化每条推文的互动、赞和书签收藏量。\n\n这两种策略可以重叠，您可能需要通过了解目标受众的偏好并分析您帐户的表现来调整您的方法。然而，必须认识到，最大化关注者和最大化每条推文的赞和书签收藏量有不同的重点，需要特定的策略。\n-> 问题: 内容元数据及其对病毒传播的影响（例如图片中的ALT文本）。\n答案: 在提供的上下文中，没有直接的信息说明内容元数据，如图片中的ALT文本，对推文或帖子的病毒性传播有何影响。然而，值得注意的是，包括ALT文本可以提高您的内容针对依赖屏幕阅读器的用户的可访问性，这可能会扩大受众并提高参与度。此外，元数据可以用于搜索引擎优化，这可能会提高内容的可见性，但提供的上下文没有提到与病毒性传播的任何具体相关性。\n-> 问题: 垃圾邮件因素的一些意外指纹是什么？\n答案: 在提供的上下文中，垃圾邮件因素的一个异常指标是推文包含非媒体、非新闻链接。如果推文有链接但没有图片 URL、视频 URL 或新闻 URL，则认为它是潜在的垃圾邮件向量，用户信誉阈值 (tweepCredThreshold) 设置为 MIN_TWEEPCRED_WITH_LINK。\n尽管这个规则可能没有涵盖所有可能的异常垃圾邮件指标，但它是从特定的代码库和逻辑中获取的。\n-> 问题：公司验证对勾和个人蓝色验证对勾有什么区别？\n答案*: 是的，公司的验证复选标记和个人的蓝色验证复选标记是有区别的。提供的代码片段提到“Blue-verified account boost”，这表明蓝色验证帐户有一个单独的类别。通常，经过验证的蓝色复选标记用于表示知名人士，而经过验证的复选标记用于公司或组织。Code Analysis Deeplake评估（Evaluation）"}

The final answer is incorrect because it uses the volume of golf balls instead of ping pong balls. The answer is not helpful.\n\nSecond, does the model use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question? The model only used one tool, which was the Search the Web (SerpAPI). It did not use the Calculator tool to calculate the correct volume of ping pong balls.\n\nThird, does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way? The model used the Search the Web (SerpAPI) tool, but the output was not helpful because it provided information about golf balls instead of ping pong balls.\n\nFourth, does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question? The model used only one step, which is not too many. However, it should have used more steps to provide a correct answer.\n\nFifth, are the appropriate tools used to answer the question? The model should have used the Search tool to find the volume of the Empire State Building and the volume of a ping pong ball. Then, it should have used the Calculator tool to calculate the number of ping pong balls needed to fill the building.\n\nJudgment: Given the incorrect final answer and the inappropriate use of tools, we give the model a score of 1.\n```\n\n这似乎是正确的。让我们试试第二个查询。\n\n```code\nquestion, steps, answer = test_outputs_two[\"input\"], test_outputs_two[\"intermediate_steps\"], test_outputs_two[\"output\"]\n\nevaluation = eval_chain(\ninputs={\"question\": question, \"answer\": answer, \"agent_trajectory\": eval_chain.get_agent_trajectory(steps)},\n)\n\nprint(\"Score from 1 to 5: \", evaluation[\"score\"])\nprint(\"Reasoning: \", evaluation[\"reasoning\"])\n```\n\n```code\nScore from 1 to 5:  3\nReasoning:  i. Is the final answer helpful?\nYes, the final answer is helpful as it provides an approximate number of Eiffel Towers needed to cover the US from coast to coast.\n\nii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?\nNo, the AI language model does not use a logical sequence of tools. It directly uses the Calculator tool without first using the Search or Lookup tools to find the necessary information (length of the Eiffel Tower and distance from coast to coast in the US).\n\niii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?\nThe AI language model uses the Calculator tool in a helpful way to perform the calculation, but it should have used the Search or Lookup tools first to find the required information.\n\niv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?\nNo, the AI language model does not use too many steps. However, it repeats the same step twice, which is unnecessary.\n\nv. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?\nNot entirely. The AI language model should have used the Search or Lookup tools to find the required information before using the Calculator tool.\n\nGiven the above evaluation, the AI language model's performance can be scored as follows:\n\n```\n\n这听起来也是对的。总之，TrajectoryEvalChain允许我们使用GPT-4来对我们的智能体的输出和工具使用进行评分，并为我们提供评估背后的推理。Hugging Face 数据集（HuggingFace Datasets）LLM 数学（LLM Math）"}

We can use the following code to calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages:\n\n/```\nshort_ma = ta.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=short_period)\nlong_ma = ta.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=long_period)\n/```\n\nThis will calculate the short-term and long-term moving averages for the stock data and store them in the `short_ma` and `long_ma` variables, respectively. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Create a new DataFrame that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can create a new DataFrame that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages using the `concat()` function from pandas. We need to pass the historical stock data, the short-term moving average, and the long-term moving average as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new DataFrame:\n\n/```\nnew_df = pd.concat([df, short_ma, long_ma], axis=1)\nnew_df.columns = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'short_ma', 'long_ma']\n/```\n\nThis will create a new DataFrame called `new_df` that combines the historical stock data with the short-term and long-term moving averages. The columns of the new DataFrame are named 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'short_ma', and 'long_ma'.

We can use the following code to create the new column:\n\n/```\nnew_df['signal'] = np.where(new_df['short_ma'] > new_df['long_ma'], 1, -1)\n/```\n\nThis will create a new column called 'signal' in the DataFrame that indicates when to buy or sell the stock based on the crossover of the short-term and long-term moving averages. If the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, the signal is 1 (buy), otherwise the signal is -1 (sell). Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target.\nInput: The stop loss and profit target as percentages.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. We need to pass the stop loss and profit target as percentages as arguments to this function. We can use the following code to create the new column:\n\n/```\nstop_loss = stop_loss_percent / 100\nprofit_target = profit_target_percent / 100\n\nnew_df['pnl'] = 0.0\nbuy_price = 0.0\nfor i in range(1, len(new_df)):\nif new_df['signal'][i] == 1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == -1:\nbuy_price = new_df['close'][i]\nelif new_df['signal'][i] == -1 and new_df['signal'][i-1] == 1:\nsell_price = new_df['close'][i]\nif sell_price <= buy_price * (1 - stop_loss):\nnew_df['pnl'][i] = -stop_loss\nelif sell_price >= buy_price * (1 + profit_target):\nnew_df['pnl'][i] = profit_target\nelse:\nnew_df['pnl'][i] = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price\n/```\n\nThis will create a new column called 'pnl' in the DataFrame that indicates the profit or loss for each trade based on the buy and sell signals and the defined stop loss and profit target. The stop loss and profit target are calculated based on the stop_loss_percent and profit_target_percent variables, respectively. The buy and sell prices are stored in the buy_price and sell_price variables, respectively. If the sell price is less than or equal to the stop loss, the profit or loss is set to -stop_loss. If the sell price is greater than or equal to the profit target, the profit or loss is set to profit_target. Otherwise, the profit or loss is calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Calculate the total profit or loss for all trades.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can calculate the total profit or loss for all trades by summing the values in the 'pnl' column of the DataFrame. We can use the following code to calculate the total profit or loss:\n\n/```\ntotal_pnl = new_df['pnl'].sum()\n/```\n\nThis will calculate the total profit or loss for all trades and store it in the total_pnl variable. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can visualize the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average using a line chart using the `plot()` function from pandas. We can use the following code to visualize the data:\n\n/```\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['short_ma'], label='Short MA')\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['long_ma'], label='Long MA')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Price')\nplt.title('Stock Data with Moving Averages')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n/```\n\nThis will create a line chart that visualizes the stock data, short-term moving average, and long-term moving average. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each line. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can visualize the buy and sell signals using a scatter plot using the `scatter()` function from matplotlib. We can use the following code to visualize the signals:\n\n/```\nbuy_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == 1]\nsell_signals = new_df[new_df['signal'] == -1]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\nplt.scatter(buy_signals.index, buy_signals['close'], label='Buy', marker='^', color='green')\nplt.scatter(sell_signals.index, sell_signals['close'], label='Sell', marker='v', color='red')\nplt.plot(new_df.index, new_df['close'], label='Close')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Price')\nplt.title('Buy and Sell Signals')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n/```\n\nThis will create a scatter plot that visualizes the buy and sell signals. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the price. The chart also includes a legend that labels each point. Next request.\n\n\nAI User (Stock Trader):\n\nInstruction: Print the total profit or loss for all trades.\nInput: None.\n\n\nAI Assistant (Python Programmer):\n\nSolution: We can print the total profit or loss for all trades using the `print()` function. We can use the following code to print the total profit or loss:\n\n/```\nprint('Total Profit/Loss: {:.2%}'.format(total_pnl))\n/```\n\nThis will print the total profit or loss for all trades in percentage format with two decimal places.

[自然语言API Chains]（../../ modules/chains/examples/openapi.html）这会在OpenAPI端点周围创建自然语言包装器。 这很有用，因为：\n-（1）插件在内部使用OpenAPI端点，\n-（2）将它们包装在NLAChain中允许路由代理更轻松地调用它们。\n本笔记中介绍的新颖思想是使用检索来选择不是显式工具， 但要使用的OpenAPI规范集。\n然后我们可以从这些OpenAPI规范中生成工具。\n这种用例是在尝试让代理使用插件时。\n选择插件可能更有效率， 然后选择端点而不是直接选择端点。\n这是因为插件可能包含更有用的选择信息。\n设置环境#\n进行必要的导入，等等。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.agents import Tool, AgentExecutor, LLMSingleActionAgent, AgentOutputParser\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import StringPromptTemplate\n\nfrom langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChain\n\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\nfrom langchain.schema import AgentAction, AgentFinish\n\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import NLAToolkit\n\nfrom langchain.tools.plugin import AIPlugin\n\nimport re\n\n\n\n```\n\n设置LLM#\n\n```code\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n\n\n\n```\n\n设置插件#\n加载和索引插件\n\n```code\nurls = [\n\n\"https://datasette.io/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://api.speak.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://www.zapier.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://www.klarna.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://www.joinmilo.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://slack.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n\"https://schooldigger.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json\",\n\n]\n\n\n\nAI_PLUGINS = [AIPlugin.from_url(url) for url in urls]\n\n\n\n```\n\n工具检索#\n我们将使用一个向量存储库为每个工具描述创建嵌入。\n然后，对于传入的查询，我们可以为该查询创建嵌入并进行相似性搜索以获取相关工具。\n\n```code\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nfrom langchain.schema import Document\n\n\n\n```\n\n```code\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\ndocs = [\n\nDocument(page_content=plugin.description_for_model,\n\nmetadata={\"plugin_name\": plugin.name_for_model}\n\n)\n\nfor plugin in AI_PLUGINS\n\n]\n\nvector_store = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)\n\ntoolkits_dict = {plugin.name_for_model:\n\nNLAToolkit.from_llm_and_ai_plugin(llm, plugin)\n\nfor plugin in AI_PLUGINS}\n\n\n\n```\n\n```code\nAttempting to load an OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec.
